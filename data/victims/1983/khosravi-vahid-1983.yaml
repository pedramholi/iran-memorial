    Mr. Vahid Khosravi is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the
    list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. News of the execution of Mr. Vahid Khosravi was also
    published by Andeesheh va Peykar Publications, 1995, in the book "An
    Unequal Battle, a report of seven years prison from 1982 to 1989" written
    by Nima Parvaresh. According to this report, the writer was a cellmate of
    Mr. Vahid Khosravi in the Evin prison. Mr. Khosravi, 22, was an active
    member of the Peykar Organization who continued his activities in Tehran
    factories after the leaders of the organization were arrested. He had been
    arrested once in Amol but escaped the prison in 1981. Mr. Vahid Khosravi
    is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on
    September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention According to Mr. Parvaresh's report, Mr.
    Vahid Khosravi was arrested in March of 1983. He was identified by a
    collaborator named Mohammadreza Nasiri. The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial According to Mr.
    Parvaresh's report, Mr. Vahid Khosravi was transferred from interrogation
    room 209 to the court two months after his arrest. His religious judge was
    Ayatollah Nayeri. No more information is available on the defendant’s
    trial. Charges No information is available on the defendant’s charges. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    According to Mr. Parvaresh's report, Mr. Vahid Khosravi defended his
    organization and Marxism in the court. Judgment According to Mr.
    Parvaresh's report, Mr. Vahid Khosravi was executed in the Evin prison on
    August 13, 1983 whereas Mojahed Magazine has reported the date of
    execution on August 07. No detailed information is available concerning
