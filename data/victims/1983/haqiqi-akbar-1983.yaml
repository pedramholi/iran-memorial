    Akbar Haqiqi s name figures in a 1999 report listing 206 Iranian Baha is
    killed by the regime since 1978, published by the Baha i International
    Community and titled Iran s Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a
    Religious Community. Mr. Akbar Haqiqi is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is
    listed in a 1999 report published by the Baha i International Community.
    The report, Iran s Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious
    Community , documents the persecutions of the members of the Faith in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since 1978. (See
    also: www.question.bahai.org). Additional information has been drawn from
    various issues of the The Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XIX,
    1982-1986, Haifa 1994. Attacks against Baha'is, including those carried
    out by non-state actors, are documented in Omid because there has been
    active and direct government involvement in the persecution of this
    minority. The government s responsibilities in these abuses are both of
    commission and omission. Commission means direct government hand in the
    persecution, trials, and deaths of scores of Baha'is. The government has
    also promulgated laws that are discriminatory against non-Muslims
    generally. However, the Baha i faith is particularly targeted since the
    government defines it as a heresy. As a result, the members of the Baha i
    community are deprived of the right to equal protection under the law and
    could be accused of apostasy. Under Islamic law, apostasy is a crime that
    may be punishable by death. While the post-revolutionary Penal code does
    not mention the crime of apostasy, Islamic Republic judicial and religious
    authorities have publicly discussed cases of apostasy. In a statement
    published in October 1981 in the Kayhan daily for example, the Head of the
    Islamic Republic Revolutionary Courts, Ayatollah Guilani and stressed
    that: the punishment for a Mortad-e Fetri [apostate who was born in a
    Muslim family] is death and his repentance is not accepted. The
    combination of such statements and articles on punishment in the Penal
    Code provided grounds for individuals, state or non-state actors, for
    killing anyone they considered to be a "pagan", an "apostate", or a
    corruptor on earth . Article 22 (or 226) of the Hudud and Qesas laws
    states that: "A homicide is punishable by Qisas only if the person killed
    did not deserve death based on Shari'a." The article specifies further
    that the murderer must prove in court that the murdered person deserved to
    be killed, allowing thus any citizen to kill another citizen based on his
    or her understanding of what is prohibited by Shari'a. The Islamic
    Republic s courts have not only prosecuted and sentenced to death Baha is
    because of their religious belief, but have refused to investigate or hold
    accountable those who have attacked members of the Baha i community. The
    inflammatory anti-Baha i statements of religious and judicial authorities
    and the impunity granted to perpetrators of attacks against the Baha is
    have further endangered members of this community and exposed them to
    violence. Against this background, Baha i activists have been victims of
    assassinations and mob killings instigated and carried out by state and
    non-state actors. By turning a blind eye, the government omitted to face
    up to its responsibilities to protect all Iranian citizens. Such omission
    is in flagrant violation of the Iranian government s obligations under
    international law. Mr. Akbar Haqiqi was murdered. Whether or not the
    assassination was the result of a sentence or a religious fatwa is not
    known. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha
    is in Iran is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was
    in this era that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the
    Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes
    and businesses and in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve
    of his return from France to Iran, in response to a question regarding
    political and religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic
    government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they
    are harmful and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer
    asked another question: Will they be free to perf
