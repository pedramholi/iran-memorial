    Mr. William Reynolds McIntyre was one of 63 victims of the bombing of the
    American Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, which took place on April 18, 1983.
    At approximately 1:05 PM, a truck loaded with nearly 2,000 pounds of
    explosives careened through the driveway of the American embassy and
    crashed into the building. A massive explosion ripped through all seven
    levels of the embassy, sending debris flying hundreds of feet into the air
    and causing the burning building to collapse on itself. In addition to
    those who lost their lives, at least 120 people were injured. At the time,
    it was the deadliest attack on an American diplomatic mission since World
    War II. Mr. McIntyre was born on March 15, 1931 in Detroit, Michigan. He
    studied political science at both the bachelor s and the master s level,
    earning both degrees from the University of Michigan. His career was
    mainly dedicated to public service, both in the United States and abroad.
    Among other positions, he worked for the U.S. Agency for International
    Development (USAID) in India and Pakistan; his last posting was in Beirut.
    In 1959, he was married to Mary Lee Lincoln; they had three children. Mr.
    McIntyre was known as an intelligent man, someone with tremendous energy
    and a buoyant sense of humor. His son Andrew recalled his joyful and
    playful spirit, his love for his family, and his enthusiasm in teaching
    them chess and taking them hiking in the hills around Islamabad. Mr.
    McIntyre enjoyed hosting dinner parties at his house and photography. His
    wife recalled an anecdote from his childhood that Mr. McIntyre liked to
    tell: as a boy, he had run a newspaper route and, by the age of fourteen,
    was able to use his earnings to purchase a Ford Model T. Of course, he
    could not drive the car, but he rented it out to other people and got them
    to drive him to athletic events. In 1981, Mr. McIntyre was appointed
    Deputy Director of USAID s office in Beirut, Lebanon; both he and his wife
    worked at the American embassy. Mrs. McIntyre, although injured, survived
    the bombing; her husband was killed while eating lunch in the embassy
    cafeteria, where he was being interviewed about USAID s programs by
    journalist Janet Lee Stevens, also killed that day. Mr. McIntyre was 52
    years old at the time of his death. Background Mr. William McIntyre is in
    Omid because of the overwhelming evidence connecting the Islamic Republic
    of Iran to the 1983 bombing at the American embassy in Beirut. This
    attack, claimed by a group called Islamic Jihad, was the first in a series
    of related bombings carried out in Lebanon between 1983 and 1984, which
    claimed at least 396 lives. In the early 1980s, Lebanon was a highly
    volatile country, home to conflicting military and political agendas and
    where the Islamic Republic exercised growing influence with the stated aim
    of spreading the Islamic Revolution. Already hostile to American influence
    in the Middle East and further angered by the United States military
    support of Iraq, Iran s foe in the Iran-Iraq war, the Islamic Republic s
    leaders became exasperated when, following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon
    in the summer of 1982, the United States brokered a Lebanese-Israeli truce
    and deployed a large contingent of American servicemen in the framework of
    a Multinational Peacekeeping Force. Islamic Jihad was a heretofore
    little-noticed group known only for a string of grenade attacks launched
    on French, Italian, and American members of the Multinational Force in
    March of 1983. When it claimed responsibility for the embassy bombing,
    Islamic Jihad declared that the attack was part of the Iranian revolution
    s campaign against imperialist targets throughout the world. The group
    promised that We shall keep striking at any imperialist presence in
    Lebanon, including the Multinational Force. (Two massive bomb attacks
    against American and French servicemen indeed followed on October 23,
    1983). Islamic Jihad was a shadowy subset of Hezbollah (Party of God), a
    radical, armed Shi ite organization with deep ideological and
    organizational ties to the Islamic Republic of Iran. As early as August of
    1979, Iran s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, had alluded to the
    establishment of a Party of God that would unite Muslims around the goal
    of resisting American and Israeli designs for the Middle East. So far, the
    oppressed have been disunited and nothing happens through disunity. Now
    that an example of the unity of the downtrodden has materialized in the
    land of Muslims [the Islamic Revolution], this example will have to be
    applied in a wider context, to encompass all humanity, through the
    establishment of a Party of the Downtrodden, which is the same as the
    Party of God [ Hezbollah ], and which is in line with the exalted will of
    God Past mistakes must be rectified through Muslim unity and the
    establishment of the Party of the Downtrodden against the great powers,
    led by the criminal America and its very corrupt stooge, Israel. *
