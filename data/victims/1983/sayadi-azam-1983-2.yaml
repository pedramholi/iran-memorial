    The execution of Ms. A’zam Sayadi was reported in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)
    in 1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. Additional information about Ms. Sayadi is taken from the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) website, as well as her
    brother-in-law’s presentation at the Second International Seminar on the
    Massacre of Iranian Political Prisoners, held in Köln, Germany, in August
    2007. Mr. Sayadi was born in Jahrom, was a high school graduate and a MKO
    sympathizer. To continue her activities with MKO and avoid being arrested
    in Jahrom, she went to Shiraz sometime before the June 20, 1981
    demonstrations. Her husband, Gholam Ali Khoshbu’i, was killed in street
    clashes in April/May 1982. Her brother-in-law, Sasan Khoshbu’i was
    executed in September 1981 in Evin prison. The demonstration of June 20,
    1981, was a protest against the parliament's impeachment of President
    Banisadr and the Islamic Republic's systematic policy of excluding the MKO
    from the country's political scene, the Ayatollah Khomeini’s refusal to
    meet with MKO leaders and his insistence to disarm them. Until that day,
    the MKO had supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to
    function within the framework of the new political system. On June 20,
    1981, the MKO officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the
    regime by organizing mass demonstrations all over the country. These
    demonstrations, which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing
    of dozens of demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and
    executions by the Revolutionary Guards and paramilitary forces that
    targeted not only the MKO, but all opposition groups. The massive
    repression, unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic,
    legitimized the months-old state harassment and suppression of dissidents
    and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent political dissent.
    Arrest and detention There is no specific information on the defendant’s
    arrest and detention. According to the MKO website, Ms. Sayadi was
    arrested in the spring of 1982. During her six-month detention in Shiraz
    prison, she was tortured severely. A prisoner who saw her four months
    after her arrest is quoted saying: “She had open wounds all over her body
    from neck to feet. You could see the flesh. It was horrific.” Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No information
    is available on Ms. Sayadi’s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on Ms. Sayadi’s defense. Judgment No specific
    information is available about this execution. According to the MKO
    website, Ms. Sayadi was executed in Shiraz prison in January 1983.
