    The execution of Mr. Jahanbakhsh Afshar, along with sixteen others, was
    announced by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor s Office
    in Tehran and reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on September 21, 1983.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Afshar was reportedly charged with being
    consistently involved in the production and distribution of heroin,
    establishment of a drug trafficking gang with another defendant,
    confessing to buying heroin in packages containing 5 gm each and dividing
    it into smaller packages for sale and having a criminal record. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Afshar's defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Section of
    the Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran sentenced Mr. Afshar to death.
    The sentence was carried out in Qasr Prison.
