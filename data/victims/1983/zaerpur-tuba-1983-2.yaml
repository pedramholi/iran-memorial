    Mrs. Tuba Za'erpur (also spelled "Za'irpur"), a retired teacher and a
    liaison between the Local Spiritual Assembly and the Baha'i community in
    Shiraz and member of several committees, is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is
    listed in a 1999 report published by the Baha i International Community.
    The report, Iran s Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious
    Community , documents the persecutions of the members of the Faith in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since 1978.
    Additional information was drawn from the newspaper Khabar-e Jonub ,
    published in Shiraz (22 February 1983), and from various issues of the The
    Baha i World .See for example: Vol. XVIII, 1979-1983, Haifa 1986 or
    description of events as published in A Tribute to the Faithful by Mah
    Mihr Gulistanih, or Olya's Story by Olya Roohizadegan. The Baha is in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand
    members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving
    them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention On 23 October 1982 a few
    revolutionary guards arrived at the home of Mrs. Za'erpur and presented an
    order for the arrest of Qudsiyyih Za'iri (A Tribute to the Faithful,
    p.138). Even though she clarified that was not her name, the officials
    searched her home, confiscated various articles and arrested her. During
    her initial interrogations at the Sepah, she was sentenced to 224 lashes
    within two days (Olya's Story, pp.118-119). She was placed in solitary
    confinement for 55 days (A Tribute to the Faithful, p.138) and was
    tortured regularly based on a misunderstanding over her position with
    regards to the Local Spiritual Assembly and suffered from many injuries as
    a result. While she was kept at the Sepah for more than 2 months, she was
    allowed a 3-minute visit with her family, but the authorities did not
    permit Tuba to receive her ulcer medication from her family, nor did they
    provide her with medical care. (A Tribute to the Faithful, p. 138).
    Because of her religious beliefs, the prison authorities considered her to
    be an unbeliever, and thus "unclean", and she was subjected to humiliating
    treatment similar to that of atheist political prisoners. Prison wardens
    refused to have any physical contact with the prisoner even when, for
    example, they were guiding the blindfolded prisoner to the interrogation
    room. In such case guards would give her the end of a folded newspaper and
    hold the other end, avoiding contact. She was transferred to Adelabad
    prison on December 26th (Olya's Story, p. 120), where she remained in
    custody until her execution. Trial There is no detail available about Mrs.
    Za'erpur's trial. However, accounts by a former prisoner state that she
    was subjected to three sessions, lasting as long as 8 hours, during which
    she was asked to recant her faith or face death by hanging. (Olya's Story,
    p. 120) Charges The text of the indictment was not provided to the family.
    However, the available information indicates that her charges were related
    to her religious beliefs and activities. The defendant was charged with
    being a Baha i and being a member of the Baha i Administration. It is also
    reported that she was charged with: "Not being married" (Olya's Story, p.
    158), which is not considered a crime in the Islamic Republic's Penal
    Code. It should also be noted that reports by her cellmates indicate that
    she was questioned more than the other Baha i prisoners due to her
    membership in the Baha i administration and was pressured to recant her
    faith. . Beca
