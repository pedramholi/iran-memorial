    The information about Mr. Soltan Ali Ashtarani has been acquired from an
    interview with his daughter. He is also one of the 12028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985, although his name is mistakenly
    published Ali Ashtarani Farid. The list includes individuals, affiliated
    with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes
    with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the
    publication date of the magazine. Mr. Ashtarani was born in Hamedan, where
    he lived and worked. He taught mathematics in a high school, but was
    purged after the 1979 Revolution due to his Marxist thinking. At the time
    of execution, Mr. Ashtarani was 49 years old. He was married and had three
    children, the youngest of whom was born while he was in prison. His
    daughter remembers, He was a kind father and spent time with us. One could
    feel joy and compassion in his presence. He was a happy man. Having
    started his political activism during the monarchy, he cooperated with the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. After the 1979 Revolution, when the
    organization split, he joined the Minority branch. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979
    revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split
    over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was active mainly
    in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Ashtarani was arrested in the spring of 1982 in his house in Hamedan by
    the Revolutionary Guards, without knowing the reason for his arrest. He
    was interrogated at the detention center of the Revolutionary Guards
    headquarters in Hamedan, where he was tortured. His family members visited
    him about 40 days after the arrest and they saw that his feet had been
    bandaged after being subjected to bastinado. Following the initial visit,
    family members visited him every Wednesday. In the winter of 1983, about
    one month prior to his execution, they were no longer allowed to visit him
    in prison. At his brother s insistence, the prison officials allowed him
    to have visitors for the Iranian new year in March of 1983. His daughter
    remembers, Our relatives were happy and they wanted to visit him in
    prison. But only my mother and siblings were allowed to actually visit
    him. My father had become very weak. This was our last visit. According to
    what his cellmates told the family, he was in good spirits in prison. On
    February 8, Mr. Ashtarani and his cellmates held a ceremony to commemorate
    the anniversary of the Siahkal incident (On February 8, 1971, the Fadayian
    Khalq Guerilla Organization attacked and attempted to overtake the police
    station in Siahkal, in the northern province of Gilan. The fighting had
    casualties for both Fadaiyan and the national army. Those members of
    Fadaiyan who were imprisoned, were put to death.) After holding the
    ceremony, Mr. Ashtarani was taken for interrogation again. His family
    members believe holding this ceremony was added as a charge to his
    indictment. Trial No information is available on Mr. Ashtarani s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Ashtarani is not known. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against Mr. Ashtarani. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Ashtarani s defense. Judgment Mr. Ashtarani was executed
    in Hamedan on April 8, 1983, along with a friend named Mr. Ali Moslem
    Khani. Mr. Ashtarani s daughter, who was an elementary school girl at the
    time states, I was at school on the day that we were informed of my father
    s execution. When I came home in the afternoon, crowd had already gathered
    in the house. My father s body had been returned and we were told to bury
    him before evening. I think my grandfather heard the news of his execution
    on the radio. It was an unbelievable scene. Mr. Ashtarani was buried at
    the public cemetery in Hamedan. Engraved on his gravestone is a poem of
    Ahmad Shamlou s. According to his daughter, My family visits him at the
    cemetery every Friday. They arrange a certain time with families of other
    execution victims so that they can visit each other at the cemetery. We
    hold memorial services for him every year. At first only relative attended
    the memorials, now more friends attend, especially my father s friends.
