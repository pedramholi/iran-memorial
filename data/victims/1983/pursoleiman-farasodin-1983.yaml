    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are

    Charges Mr. Pursoleiman was reportedly charged with dealing 55.800 kg of
    opium. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought
    trumped up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Pursoleiman s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Mashad sentenced Mr. Pursoleiman to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Islamic Revolution s Supreme Court, the sentence was
    carried out.
