circumstances: >
    Information about Mr. Bahador Nezamkhan Mohimi, son of Alikhan, was sent
    to Omid by persons close to him, via electronic forms. His execution,
    along with two other men, was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    September 4, 1984. According to existing reports, Mr. Mohimi was born in
    Mishpedum, near Kahnuj city, in the eastern province of Kerman in 1956. He
    was single, a high school graduate, a farmer, and a khan in the Kahnuj and
    Jiroft area. Arrest and Detention Mr. Bahador Nezamkhan Mohimi was
    arrested on April 9, 1984, in Jiroft (Kerman Province). According to the
    information sent to Omid, he had no access to an attorney and only had
    visits twice with his family. Trial Based on the newspaper report, Mr.
    Mohimi was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Jiroft and Kahnuj.
    According to one electronic form, he was tried in Jiroft. Charges
    According to the newspaper report, Mr. Mohimi was charged with military
    action against the Islamic Republic through collaboration with other
    rebellious chieftains and thugs; extorting money from poor people in
    Jiroft and Kahnuj; making armed threats and terrorizing people in those
    cities; participating in martyring two Revolutionary Guards and a
    Hezbollahi brother; carrying and storing weapons of war; and collaboration
    with atheist groups. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Mohimi. Defense No information is available about Mr. Mohimi s defence.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Jiroft and Kahnuj called Mr.
    Mohimi a corruptor on Earth and an enemy of God and sentenced him to
    death. The Supreme Judicial Council approved the ruling. He was executed
    by firing squad in Jiroft on September 3, 1984, at midnight. He was 28
    years old. According to the information sent to Omid, authorities did not
    give his body and the bodies of his two relatives to their families, but
    since this resulted in turmoil across the city, they changed their minds,
    and all three bodies were buried at a family cemetery in Naserabad.
    According to the same report, all properties of Mr. Alikhan Mohimi (the
    victim s father) in Jiroft and southern Rudbar were confiscated and given
    to the Mostaz afan Foundation [a charitable and enterprising
    organization].
