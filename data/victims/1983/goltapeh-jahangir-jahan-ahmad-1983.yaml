    News of the execution of Mr. Jahangir Ahmad-Goltapeh, son of Shir ali, a
    member of the Ettehadieh Komonist-ha, along with 21 others, was reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on January 27, 1983. The report quotes the
    public relations office of the Islamic Revolution s Public Prosecutor s
    Office in Tehran. The information about his charges and defense was
    published in the same newspaper on January 9, 1983, and in the Kayhan
    newspaper on January 29, 1983. This execution was also reported in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No. 261), published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes 12,028 individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Additional information about Mr.
    Ahmad-Goltapeh is based on an electronic form sent to Omid by a person
    familiar with his case. The Ettehadieh Komonist-ha was created by exiled
    opponents of the Pahlavi regime, who mostly belonged to the Student
    Confederation. They followed the teachings of Mao Tse-Tung but did not
    believe in guerilla warfare. The group became marked by ideological
    divisions during the periods preceding and following the 1979 revolution,
    which caused it to split into several factions. One of the most important
    rifts was triggered by the decision of a number of members to take up arms
    and to take over a city in Iran. The uprising plan, devised in the midst
    of an active and violent anti-communist campaign by the revolutionary
    Islamic government, split the Ettehadieh in two factions: one believed in
    the armed movement, and the other opposed it. In the winter of 1982, armed
    members of the Ettehadieh hid in a forest in the North of Iran ( Jangal in
    Farsi) outside the city of Amol. This group, also known as the Jangal
    group, was involved in several clashes with the Revolutionary Guards and,
    ultimately, on January 26, attacked the city of Amol, hoping to generate a
    general uprising. The attempt to seize Amol failed. It is reported that a
    number of the group s members, Revolutionary Guards, and civilians were
    killed during the Amol clash. Subsequently, members of the Ettehadieh,
    including those who opposed the Amol uprising, were arrested and tried for
    belonging to the organization and for having participated in the Amol
    clash. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Jahangir
    Ahmad-Goltapeh s arrest and detention are not known. According to
    information sent to Omid , he had gone to Tehran from Amol on foot. In
    spite of his relatives insistence that he leave the country, he stayed and
    was arrested at his home in Tehran. Only his (more than thirty) family
    members were permitted to visit him at early hours of the morning. Because
    of this, when his mother was going to visit him in the dark hours of a
    morning, she had an accident with a car and died. Trial Based on the
    existing reports, Mr. Jahangir Ahmad-Goltapeh, along with 28 or 29 others,
    was tried between January 9 and 15, 1983. The trial took place at Branch
    One of the Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecutor s Office in Evin Prison
    in Tehran, with Ayatollah Mohammadi-Gilani as the presiding judge. Charges
    Mr. Jahangir Ahmad-Goltapeh s indictment was read to him by Asadollah
    Lajevardi, Tehran s Public Prosecutor. The text of this indictment is as
    follows: Being active in counter-revolutionary grouplets from 1980 until
    September 1982; being a member of the Union of Communists of Iran (
    Sarbedaran ) and staying in the forests of Amol for six months in order to
    conduct military action against the divine government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Moreover, he was charged with directly participating in
    the armed clashes of November 13 in the forest, where one revolutionary
    guard was martyred, directly participating in Razkeh clashes directly
    participating in attacking Amol on January 26, 1982, and killing tens of
    Hezbollah community members ( Ommat ) - he used a G3 gun in this clash and
    was the head of the team, wounding several Revolutionary Guards and
    Gendarmerie forces, as well as unarmed civilians, which in some cases led
    to their martyrdom directly participating in the clashes of February 9,
    1982, in Gaznehsarah, where he was wounded in the head. The Islamic
    Revolution s Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran declared that Mr.
    Ahmad-Goltapeh s culpability was indisputable. Therefore, the Public
    Prosecutor asked for the maximum penalty possible. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    There is no mention of documented evidence against Mr. Ahmad-Goltapeh. The
    report states that he admitted to having stolen food while in the forest
    and having taken part in clashes with the security forces, which resulted
    in the death of one revolutionary guard and the injury of a doctor.
