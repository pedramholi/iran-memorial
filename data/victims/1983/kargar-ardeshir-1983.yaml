    The information about Mr. Ardeshir Kargar was obtained through an
    interview with his brother. Mr. Kargar, son of Yahya, was born in 1957 in
    Hamedan, where he went to school and earned his high school diploma. At
    the time of the revolution in 1979, he was serving in the compulsory
    draft. He escaped the military service because he did not want to be
    forced to kill anybody. He started to work as an electronics repairman. In
    early 1979, Mr. Kargar sold tapes of revolutionary songs in front of
    Tehran University. After some time, he returned to Hamedan where he
    continued his political activities. According to his brother, Mr. Kargar
    was cheerful, optimistic, and he positively influenced people around him.
    His cellmates witnessed that he was in high spirits even as he was being
    taken for execution. Mr. Kargar had good relations with everyone,
    especially youth. He was well known and respected among political
    activists. He was a member of the Fadayian Khalq Guerilla Organization.
    Following the 1979 Revolution, most members of this organization renounced
    armed struggle. Those who still believed in armed action split from
    Fadaiyan and founded the Ashraf Dehqani faction. Soon, more radical
    members of this faction split from this group and founded the Freedom
    Fighters of the New Movement ( Artesh-e Raha i Bakhsh-e Jonbesh-e Novin-e
    Khalq ). Mr. Kargar cooperated with the latter group. The Fadayian Khalq
    Guerilla Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban
    Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded
    in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following
    the 1979 Revolution, the organization, which renounced armed struggle,
    split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union.
    A number of the organization s members, who did not renounce armed
    struggle, founded the group The Fadayian Khalq Guerillas (Ashraf Dehqani
    Branch). Arrest and detention Mr. Kargar was arrested in Hamedan in the
    late spring of 1983. The reason for his arrest is not known. Based on the
    information his family gathered after his execution, two leftist political
    activists were arrested in relation with the assassination of a
    Revolutionary Guardsman. Under pressure, these persons informed the prison
    interrogators of Mr. Kargar s whereabouts. Initially the interrogators
    were not aware of Mr. Kargar s political activities and they reportedly
    intended to release him. However, soon they found out more about his
    activities through other detainees, and Mr. Kargar was subjected to more
    severe interrogations. Trial There is no information regarding the trial
    other than that Mr. Kargar was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Hamedan. Charges The charges brought against the defendant are not known.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the evidence
    presented against the accused. Defense No information is available
    concerning Mr. Kargar s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Hamedan sentenced Mr. Kargar to death. He was executed by firing squad
    on June 23, 1983. He was 26 years old. Generally the mode of execution in
    Hamedan was hanging. However, Mr. Ardeshir Kargar and a sympathizer of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization, named Mohammad Reza Heidari,were shot by
    firing squad. They both were taken from Section 2 of Hamedan Prison for
    execution. Their cellmates later told the victims families that the night
    of the execution a prison guard furtively told them that they were going
    to be executed. Mr. Kargar showered and put on a clean white shirt. As a
    last meal, Mr. Heidari shared a watermelon with his cellmates. Mr. Kargar
    is buried at the Bagh-e Behesht cemetery in Hamedan.
