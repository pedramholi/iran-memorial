    The execution of Mr. Habibollah Dashtnur was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on December 12, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Dashtnur
    was reportedly charged with armed robberies, repeatedly causing traffic
    jams and terrorizing and intimidating people in the region. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Dashtnur's defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Fars declared Mr. Dashtnur a corruptor
    on earth and sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by Qom s
    Tribunal, the sentence was carried out at dawn.
