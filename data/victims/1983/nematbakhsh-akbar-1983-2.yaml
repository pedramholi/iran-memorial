    The information about Mr. Akbar Ne’matbakhsh, son of Hossein, was sent to
    Omid by a person familiar with this case. His name is also mentioned among
    the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Ne’matbakhsh was
    born in Esfahan and sympathized with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO).* Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The charge brought against the defendant is not
    known. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Ne’matbakhsh’s defense. In spite of the
    “armed struggle” announcement by the MKO on June 20, 1981, many
    sympathizers of the organization had no military training, were not armed,
    and did not participate in armed conflict. Judgment There is no
    information on the verdict leading to this execution. Mr. Ne’matbakhsh was
    executed by firing squad on August 15, 1983 in Tehran. He was 25 years
    old. *The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, their interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed
    in armed struggle against the Shah's regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after many of its members were killed and the purge
    of other Muslim members, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move created a tense and critical atmosphere among the
    Muslim activists and sympathizers of the MKO, and finally led to
    pronouncement of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1977. In January of 1979 the imprisoned Muslim leaders of
    the MKO were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization’s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but their efforts to gain political power, either by
    becoming appointed officials or elected by the people, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic authorities. The exclusion of MKO members
    from government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing
    houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities’ different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as “Hypocrites” and the
    Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers
    regularly during demonstrations and while distributing publications,
    leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO
    called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental
    officials and the effort to impeach their ally, President Banisadr.
    Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration illegal,
    thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary
    Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties from the demonstration
    is unknown but a large number of demonstrators were arrested and executed
    in the following days and weeks. Following that day, the Islamic Republic
    regime started a repressive campaign – unprecedented in modern Iranian
    history – and thousands of MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or
    executed. On June 21, 1981, the MKO announced an armed struggle against
    the Islamic Republic and assassinated a number of high ranking officials
    and supporters of the Islamic regime over the next weeks and months. In
    the summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the impeached President
    (Abolhassan Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in France, where he founded the
    National Council of Resistance. After the MKO leaders and many of its
    members were expelled from France, they went to Iraq and founded the
    National Liberation Army of Iran in 1987, which entered Iranian territory
    a few times during the Iran-Iraq war. They were defeated in July 1988
    during their last operation, the Forugh Javidan Ope
