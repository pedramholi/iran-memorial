    The information about Mr. Hossein Avardin is taken from the book Our
    Martyrs in the Path to Freedom by Rah-e Kargar publications, copyright
    1988. He began his political activities in the 1950s. During the 1960s, he
    joined the Revolutionary Communists Organization of Iran (SAKA). In 1970,
    he was arrested and imprisoned until the 1979 Revolution. He was one of
    the first members of the Rah-e Kargar Organization. "Rah-e Kargar" or the
    "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the summer
    of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist
    groups who rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political
    action. They introduced themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a
    socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed
    with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the
    Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention

    the Evin Prison, Asadollah Lajevardi, who had been Mr. Ordin s prison mate

    the defendant. Defense No information is available about the defendant s
    defense. Judgment No specific information is available about the defendant
