    was born in 1956. He was studying structural engineering in Baguio City in
    the Philippines. He was active in the student movement opposing the
    Islamic Republic and went back and forth to the capital city Manila.
    According to multiple reports, he was a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran (Interview with Behrang Ejtehadi who was an activist
    in the student movement in the Philippines, April 18, 2024; Mojahed
    Publication, February 17, 1983; Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran
    Website, April 7, 2008; Eshterak Weblog, December 7, 2010; Washington
    Post, March 29, 1984). Mr. Rahimi was a sincere youth and he was very
    active in political activities (Interview with Behrang Ejtehadi, active in
    the student movement in the Philippines, April 18, 2024). Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965.
    This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to the split of the
    Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the
    imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with other
    political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new
    members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Background of Student Movement in the
    Philippines The Iranian Student Movement in the Philippines was
    established before January 1979, as was the case in many other countries.
    Iranians had started to enroll in Philippine colleges and universities
    since the early 1980s. Students were attracted to these institutions of
    higher learning for their low-cost tuition and use of English
