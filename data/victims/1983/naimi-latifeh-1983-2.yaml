    Association of Iranian Women of Köln (Germany). The list, "A Partial List

    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. Then, she joined the Rah-e Kargar
    Organization and took charge of distributing its publications in Shiraz.
    In 1982, she started working in a clinic as a nurse. "Rah-e Kargar" or the
    "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the summer
    of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist
    groups who rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political
    action. They introduced themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a
    socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed
    with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the
    Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention
