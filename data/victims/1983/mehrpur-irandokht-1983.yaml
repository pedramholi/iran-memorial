    The information regarding Ms. Irandokht (Puran) Mehrpur is based on an
    electronic form sent by Ms. Monireh Baradaran and a report by Ms. Mihan
    Rusta in The Book of Prison - Volume 2, published by Noghteh Books in
    2001. According to the information provided, Ms. Mehrpur was born into a
    Zoroastrian family in Nahavand, in 1945. Her elementary education was
    completed in a Zoroastrian school called Giv. She continued her education
    at Anushirvan and Kharazmi high schools in Tehran. She was a great athlete
    and became the national champion in swimming and mountain climbing,
    receiving gold medals. After graduating from high school, she became a
    hostess with the Iranian National Airline. In 1970, she went to London for
    training and, after returning to Iran, she went back to London the next
    year. In 1973, she joined the Confederation of Iranian Students. During
    this period, she went to Germany to complete a two-year program in
    publishing. In September of 1978, she returned to Iran and founded a
    leftist group called Arman-e Kargar (Worker s Ideal) with her friends.
    After the revolution, she worked as a simple worker in a pharmaceutical
    company called Darugar, in order to participate in the workers' movement.
    After some of her comrades were arrested, she went to Kurdistan and spent
    four months there. Then she returned to Tehran. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    According to the information sent to Omid, Ms. Irandokht Mehrpur was

    seventeen-day-old baby daughter. She was pressured in prison to perform
    Islamic prayers, in spite of being raised in a Zoroastrian family. But she
    resisted and defended her beliefs as a communist. Her resistance is

    some of her group members, including her husband, to repent and
    participate in television confessions. Trial No information is available
