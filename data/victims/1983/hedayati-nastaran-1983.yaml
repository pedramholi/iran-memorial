    Ms. Nastaran Hedayati is one of the 1,533 executed prisoners listed by the
    Association of Iranian Women of Köln (Germany). The list was published on
    September 10, 1997 under the title: “A Partial List of Names of Women
    Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran.” This list has been updated by
    former political prisoners. Ms. Nastaran Hedayati is also one of the
    12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The
    additional information about Ms. Nastaran Hedayati was drawn from the
    website of the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO). She was
    born in Shiraz, and a student majoring in National Development. In 1979,
    she joined the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) and after June 20, 1981,
    she became a commander of a Resistance Unit for the MKO. The
    demonstrations of June 20, 1981, took place in protest against the
    parliament's impeachment of President Banisadr and the Islamic Republic's
    systematic policy of excluding the MKO from the country's political scene,
    the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with MKO leaders and his
    insistence to disarm them. Until that day, the MKO had supported the
    leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to operate within the
    framework of the new political system. However, on June 20th, the MKO
    officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the regime by
    organizing mass demonstrations all over the country. These demonstrations,
    which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing of dozens of
    demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and executions by
    both the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces. These groups
    targeted not only the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive
    repression legitimized the months-old policy of state harassment and the
    suppression of dissidents ultimately resulting in the banning of all forms
    of independent political dissent. Arrest and detention According to the
    MKO website, Ms. Nastaran Hedayati was arrested by the Revolutionary
    Guards in her home on December 24, 1981 and was taken to the Guards Prison
    in Shiraz. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges No information is available on Ms. Nastaran Hedayati’s charges.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available about
    her defense. Judgment Ms. Nastaran Hedayati was executed in Shiraz on June
    28, 1983. The MKO website quotes a witness saying: "they tortured her
    along with several other MKO members using machines with loaders with
    which they hanged them with barb wire until they died."
