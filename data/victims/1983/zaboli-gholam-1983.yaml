    The execution of Mr. Gholam Zaboli, along with twelve others, was
    announced in a communiqu by the Islamic Revolution s Committee in Sistan
    and Baluchestan. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on
    December 20, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Zaboli was reportedly
    charged with being actively involved in the production and distribution of
    narcotics; that is, the wholesale of 300 kg of opium. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Zaboli s
    defense. Judgment According to this report, Mr. Zaboli was executed. The
    Tribunal which issued his death sentence was not specified.
