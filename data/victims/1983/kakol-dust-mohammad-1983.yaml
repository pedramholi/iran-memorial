    The execution of Mr. Dust Mohammad Kakol, along with 10 others, was
    announced in a communiqu by the public relations of the Islamic Revolution
    s Public Prosecutor s Office in Sistan and Baluchestan. The communiqu was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on October 1, 1983. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Mr. Kakol was reportedly charged with importing 10 kg of hashish
    and being actively involved in drug trafficking. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Kakol's
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Sistan and
    Baluchestan sentenced Mr. Kakol to death. Having been confirmed by the
    Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out in public in the
    Addicts Rehabilitation Center.
