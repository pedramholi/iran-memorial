    The execution of Mr. Aqarahim Jalili, along with three others, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on August 10, 1983. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Mr. Jalili was reportedly charged with entering Iran illegally,
    organizing a gang of armed robbers and robbing people's houses with arms
    which led to the murder of two persons in one case and physical disability
    in another. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Jalili's defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Behshahr declared Mr. Jalili an enemy of God and
    a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by
    the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out.
