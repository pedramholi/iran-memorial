    The execution of Mr. Abdolrahman Azmayesh, a member of the Ettehadieh
    Komonist-ha, along with 21 others, was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on January 27, 1983. This report quotes the public relations of the
    Islamic Revolution s Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The information
    about his charges and defenses was published in the same newspaper on
    January 11, 1983. This execution was also reported in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in
    1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. Further information about Mr. Azmayesh, a father of one, was
    sent to Omid via an electronic form by a person familiar with the case.
    The Ettehadieh Komonist-ha (the Union of Communists of Iran) was created
    by exiled opponents of the Pahlavi regime who mostly belonged to the
    Student Confederation. They followed the teachings of Mao Tse-Tung and did
    not believe in guerilla warfare. The group became marked by ideological
    divides during the periods preceding and following the 1979 revolution
    which caused it to split into several factions. One of the most important
    rifts was triggered by the decision by a number of members to take up arms
    and take over a city in Iran. The uprising plan, devised in the midst of
    an active and violent anti-communist campaign by the revolutionary Islamic
    government, split the Union in two factions: one supporting the armed
    movement and the other opposing it. In the winter of 1982, armed members
    of the Union hid in a forest in the North of Iran (Jangal in Farsi)
    outside the city of Amol. This group, also known as the Sarbedaran-e
    Jangal , was involved in several clashes with the Revolutionary guards and
    ultimately, on January 26, attacked the city of Amol hoping to generate a
    general uprising. The attempt to seize Amol failed. It is reported that a
    number of the group s members, revolutionary guards, and civilians were
    killed during the Amol clash. Subsequently, members of the Union,
    including those who opposed the Amol uprising, were arrested and tried for
    belonging to the organization and for having participated in the Amol
    clash Arrest and detention According to the form, Mr. Azmayesh was
    arrested on July 14, 1981, at around 7 pm, at a restaurant. He was
    detained at section 209 of the Evin Prison for six months prior to his
    execution. He was denied access to legal counsel. Trial According to this
    report Mr. Azmayesh was tried along with 28 to 29 others between January
    9th and 15th, 1983. The trial took place at the 1st division of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran with Ayatollah
    Mohammadi Gilani as the residing judge. Charges Mr. Azmayesh s indictment
    was read to him by Asadollah Lajevardi, Tehran s Public Prosecutor. The
    text of this indictment is as follows: being a member of the Central
    Committee in the [Union of Communists of Iran], as well as the
    Confederation [of the Iranian Students] in the United States,
    participating in the third convention of the organization and being
    elected as the head of the workers section. His other charges were being
    responsible for organizing the Tehran Committee , being in charge of the
    workers section in the organization whose function was infiltrating
    factories and leading the workers astray, as well as inducing them to join
    the Union , and leading all the strikes and counter-revolutionary
    activities of the [Union of Communists of Iran] in factories. It was also
    mentioned in the indictment that when he was in charge of the Organization
    in Tehran he was responsible for all its activities there such as the
    armed rebellion of the Sarbedaran-e Jangal which was supposed to be
    carried out in Tehran at first, but for some reason its location was
    changed to the forests of Amol. The defendant played a significant role in
    the transportation of organization s weapons which were concealed in
    several suitcases by his subjects. Moreover, he had participated
    effectively in transferring the Head of Sarbedaran Committee; i.e. Hossein
    Riahi, to the forest. The Public Prosecutor of Tehran ended the indictment
    by this statement: There are tens of such charges and one can easily
    understand what it means to be the Head of Tehran Committee in such an
    atheist organization. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense According to this report, Mr. Azmayesh pleaded guilty
    to all the charges in the indictment and gave further explanations about
    them. However the defendant s explanations were not mentioned in the
    report. Judgment The 1st division of the Islamic Revolutionary Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran sentenced Mr. Azmayesh to death. The
    sentence was carried out at 9 pm.
