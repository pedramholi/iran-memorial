circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Yacub Irandust, along with 10 others, was announced
    in a communiqu by the public relations of the Islamic Revolution s Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Sistan and Baluchestan. The communiqu was reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on October 1, 1983. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr.
    Irandust was reportedly charged with having contacts with smugglers and
    participating in the supply, distribution and transportation of 87 kg of
    hashish. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Irandust's defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Sistan and Baluchestan sentenced Mr.
    Irandust to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council,
    the sentence was carried out in public in the Addicts Rehabilitation
    Center.
