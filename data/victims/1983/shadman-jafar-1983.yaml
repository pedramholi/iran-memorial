    The execution of Mr. Ja far Shadman, along with eight others, was reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami Daily on October 31, 1983. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr.
    Shadman was reportedly charged with drug dealing and distribution and
    collaboration in the sale of 620 gm of heroin. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Shadman
    s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashad sentenced
    Mr. Shadman to death. Having been confirmed by the Islamic Revolution s
    Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out.
