    The execution of Mr. Karim Musazadeh, along with sixteen others, was
    announced in a communiqu by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on October 8, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Musazadeh was
    reportedly charged with being actively involved in the supply and
    distribution of narcotics, establishing an international drug trafficking
    gang, and having been convicted several times. He was also charged with
    possessing 32 kg of morphine, 2042 kg of opium and 360 liter of acid
    anhydric as well as possessing equipments and materials for supplying
    heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Musazadeh's defense. Judgment The
    Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal in Tehran declared Mr.
    Musazadeh a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out at 5 a.m.
