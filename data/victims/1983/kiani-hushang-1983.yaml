    Mr. Hushang Kiani s name has been sent to Omid via an electronic form by
    an individual close to him. According to this form, he was affiliated with
    the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. Mr. Kiani is also one of the 12028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979
    revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split
    over the support to the Islamic Republic and to the Soviet Union. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was mainly active
    in the political arena and the labor movement. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority
    considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist
    regime and supported it. It shared the views of the Tudeh Party and
    collaborated with the government. By 1983, however, its political beliefs
    made its supporters the target of the Islamic Republic s repression.
