    The information about Mr Abbas Barkhordar is based on a book titled

    Mortazavi, Germany, 1999. This execution was also reported in an addendum

    Organization in 1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication

    Marxist – Leninist and followers of Mao Tse-Tung’s school of thought. They
    opposed the USA and the USSR and supported Ruhollah Khomeini as an
    anti-imperialist leader. During the massive repression of 1981, the party
    was banned and its leaders were executed. Its publication, Ranjbar , is
    occasionally published outside Iran since 1981. Arrest and detention The
