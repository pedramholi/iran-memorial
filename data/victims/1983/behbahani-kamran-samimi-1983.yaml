    The execution of Mr. Kamran Samimi Behbahani, a member of the Ettehadieh
    Komonist-ha, along with 21 others, was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on January 27, 1983. The report quotes the public relations of the
    Islamic Revolution’s Public Prosecutor’s Office in Tehran. The information
    about his charges and defenses was published in the same newspaper on
    January 11, 1983. This execution was also reported in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in
    1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. The Ettehadieh Komonist-ha (the Union of Communists of Iran)
    was created by exiled opponents of the Pahlavi regime who mostly belonged
    to the Student Confederation. They followed the teachings of Mao Tse-Tung
    and did not believe in guerilla warfare. The group became marked by
    ideological divides during the periods preceding and following the 1979
    revolution which caused it to split into several factions. One of the most
    important rifts was triggered by the decision by a number of members to
    take up arms and take over a city in Iran. The uprising plan, devised in
    the midst of an active and violent anti-communist campaign by the
    revolutionary Islamic government, split the Union in two factions: one
    supporting the armed movement and the other opposing it. In the winter of
    1982, armed members of the Union hid in a forest in the North of Iran
    (Jangal in Farsi) outside the city of Amol. This group, also known as the
    Sarbedaran-e Jangal , was involved in several clashes with the
    Revolutionary guards and ultimately, on January 26, attacked the city of
    Amol hoping to generate a general uprising. The attempt to seize Amol
    failed. It is reported that a number of the group’s members, revolutionary
    guards, and civilians were killed during the Amol clash. Subsequently,
    members of the Union, including those who opposed the Amol uprising, were
    arrested and tried for belonging to the organization and for having
    participated in the Amol clash Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial According to
    this report Mr. Samimi Behbahani was tried along with 28 to 29 others
    between January 9th and 15th, 1983. The trial took place at the 1st
    division of the Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecutor’s Office in Tehran
    with Ayatollah Mohammadi Gilani as the residing judge. Charges Mr. Samimi
