    The information about Mr. Kuchak Aqa Namazi, son of Rajab Ali, is based on
    an interview with a person close to him. Mr. Namazi was born in Zanjan on
    March 26, 1949. He graduated from the Commerce College in Tehran. He was
    married and had a daughter. Initially, he was a member of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. After the arrest of the Mojahedin leaders in 1971, he
    went underground and then, left the country. He was a member of the
    Mojahedin until 1975. Then, he became a member of the Marxist-Leninist
    section of Mojahedin Khalq Organization. He returned back to Iran days
    before the revolution. In Iran, he was a high ranking member of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class and in charge of the
    editorial of the Peykar publication. This execution was also announced,
    under the name Mohammad Namazi, in the addendum of the Mojahed magazine,
    No. 261, published by the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization on September 6,
    1985. The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. Additionally, he is one of the 430 individuals whose name
    appears on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Peykar
    Andeesheh. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class
    was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention Mr. Kuchak Aqanamazi was arrested on his
    way from Karaj to Tehran on July 19, 1983. He was on his way to the
    hospital to seek treatment for cancer, but he never reached the hospital.
    There was no news of him for 40 days. He was detained at Evin prison
    incommunicado. He was denied the right to be represented by an attorney.
    After 40 days, he called his father’s house in Zanjan and talked to his
    sister for few minutes. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. Kuchak Aqa
    Namazi’s charges. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available about his defense. Judgment
    Mr. Kuchak Aqa Namazi was executed by a firing squad on August 31, 1983.
    No specific information is available about the execution sentence.
    According to persons close to him, the prison officials called his family
    and, without any explanation, told them to go for his body. When they went
    to the prison, they were told: “you are late, we buried him.” The family
    went to the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. The mortician told them that Mr.
    Namazi had six bullet holes in his body. He was surprised because the
    others were executed by four bullets.
