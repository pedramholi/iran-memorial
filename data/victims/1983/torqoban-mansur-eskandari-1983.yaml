    The information about Mr. Mansur Eskandari Torqoban, son of Hossein, was
    sent to Omid by a relative via an electronic form. He is also one of the
    12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Eskandari Torqoban
    was born on September 24, 1950 in Torqoban (in today’s Khorasan Razavi
    province). He was a student of medicine and sympathized with the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization – Minority branch. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a
    Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist
    groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was active mainly in the
    political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and detention The
