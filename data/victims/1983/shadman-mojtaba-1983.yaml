    The information about Mr. Mojtaba Shadman has been drawn from an interview
    with a former cellmate. This person stated: “I met him in prison. We were
    in the same cell for four months and we became close friends… When I was
    taken for interrogation, I was wearing his jacket. When I was returned, he
    had been already taken to another cell. The Revolutionary Guards took away
    his jacket from me…” Mr. Shadman was affiliated with the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization (Minority branch). The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist
    Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla
    movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups
    opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was active mainly in the
    political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Shadman’s arrest and detention are not known other
    than when he was arrested, he was armed; he was kept in Evin prison. Trial

    cellmate, Mr. Shadman had told him that he was charged with “armed robbery
    and participation in armed clashes.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused, other
    than he was armed at the time of arrest. Defense No information is
