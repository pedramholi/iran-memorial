    The information about Mr. Qodrat Fazeli was taken from the Tufan Party
    website and a person close to him has confirmed the information. Mr.
    Fazeli was born in 1948 in Mahmudabad in the Mazandaran Province. He was
    married and he had a child who was born in prison. He graduated from the
    Iran University of Science and Technology with a degree in mechanical
    engineering. He is remembered for his smile and his trustworthiness. Mr.
    Fazeli was one of the leaders of the Tufan Party. He began his political
    activism before the Revolution. After graduating from university, he went
    to a remote and impoverished place, in the Sistan and Baluchestan
    Provinces, and lived in villages near Zahedan for some time. In 1973, he
    became familiar with the Tufan Party and joined the Party’s Research Team
    within the Planning Committee, which conducted field work in villages. The
    Party later published findings of this research project in 1978, entitled,
    “An Introduction to Society and Class Relations.” Due to his political
    activism, Mr. Fazeli was arrested by the SAVAK (the National Intelligence
    and Security Organization), but he was released because there was no
    evidence against him. After his release, he was under SAVAK’s
    surveillance, and therefore could not continue his political activities in
    Zahedan. He decided to return to Mazandaran, where he resumed his
    activities with the Tufan Party. He founded a base for the Party in the
    Province and established an underground publishing house. He was in charge
    of the publication of the Tufan magazine until the Revolution. In 1980,
    Hezbollahi agents equipped with clubs raided his father’s house in
    Mahmudabad, but he was not there. After some time, the Revolutionary
    Guards ambushed his house, but Mr. Fazeli had already escaped. Since then,
    he led an underground life in Tehran. In April 1981, he was elected as a
    member of the central committee of the Tufan Party. Mr. Fazeli’s younger
    brother, Daryush Fazeli, and his brother-in-law, Janbarar Ruhi were also
    executed, in 1982 and 1981 respectively. Hezb-e Kar (the Labor Party, or
    Tufan) was founded as a result of a split from the Tudeh Party of Iran
    (Dec. 10, 1963). The Iran Labor Party calls itself Marxist-Leninist and
    communist. The Party believes that after the death of Stalin, who had
    established the dictatorship of the proletariat in its true sense, the
    Soviet Union became a social imperialist country. The Party supports the
    overthrow of the Islamic Republic and the establishment of a proletarian
    dictatorship. Its activities are mainly concentrated outside Iran. The
    Iran Labor Party is a member of the International Conference of
    Marxist-Leninist Parties and Organizations, and it publishes the magazine
    Tufan . Arrest and detention Mr. Fazeli was arrested in December 1982 in
    Tehran along with his pregnant wife. They were both taken to the infamous
    Joint Committee. According to the statements of other prisoners who were
    kept at the Joint Committee at the same time, Mr. Fazeli was severely
    tortured; and even his pregnant wife was tortured in front of him. Prison
    authorities did not give him food and he lost weight. His wife gave birth
    in prison. Throughout the interrogation period, Mr. Fazeli was deprived of
    the right to have visitors. The Joint Committee was established during the
    Monarchy and called the Joint Anti-Sabotage Committee. After the
    Revolution, it was renamed Tohidi Prison and then Ward 3000. Most of its
    cells were for solitary confinement where prisoners were interrogated and
    tortured. In the 1990s, the prison became the Ebrat Museum. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Fazeli’s trial. Charges The charge brought
    against Mr. Fazeli is not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Fazeli’s
    defense. He was denied the right to have an attorney. Judgment According
    to a former cellmate, in January 1983, Mr. Qodrat Fazeli was taken for
    interrogation one day and he never returned. This cellmate states, “He
    probably died under torture.” Mr. Fazeli is buried in Khavaran Cemetery.
