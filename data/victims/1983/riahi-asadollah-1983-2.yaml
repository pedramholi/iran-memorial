    The information about Mr. Asadollah Riahi is taken from the book The Tudeh
    Martyrs , copyright 2001 by The Tudeh Party of Iran publications. He was
    born in Shahrekord. He was a member of the Tudeh Party. After receiving
    his Master degree in Sociology from a university in France, he returned to
    Iran and worked as a teacher in Shahr-e-kord. After the Revolution, he was
    expelled from the teaching job and worked full time for the Party. The
    Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh's ideology was
    Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The
    Tudeh Party played a major role in Iran's political scene until it was
    banned for the second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the
    1979 Revolution, the Tudeh Party declared the Ayatollah Khomeini and his
    Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively
    supported the new government. Although the Tudeh Party never opposed the
    Islamic Republic, it became the target of government attacks from 1982
    when most of the Party's leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and
