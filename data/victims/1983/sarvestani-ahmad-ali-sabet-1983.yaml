    Information concerning Mr. Ahmad Ali Sabet Sarvestani s (child of
    Shokrollah) death in detention was obtained from an interview conducted by
    the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with one of his relatives on July 15,
    2017. Additional information about this case was obtained from the
    Remembering the Martyrs of the Baha i Faith program on Baha i News TV,
    Baha i News Magazine (October 30, 2015), the Archives of Baha i
    Persecution in Iran website, as well as from documents available at the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center. Mr. Sabet Sarvestani was one of the 206
    individuals whose name was published in the Worldwide Baha i Community s
    1999 report. This report, entitled The Baha i Question: Iran s Secret
    Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious Community , dealt with the
    persecution of members of the Baha i faith in Iran by the Islamic
    Republic, and contained a list of Baha is who were killed in Iran since
    1979. Mr. Sabet Sarvestani was born on March 25, 1912 in the town of
    Sarvestan in Fars Province. His father was a missionary of the Baha i
    faith in the town of Sarvestan. He was the youngest member of the family
    and lost his mother when he was still a child. Mr. Sarvestani first
    attended Maktab (traditional Iranian primary school) and was then sent to
    [a regular] school. He was married in 1938-39 and had 9 children. In
    1944-45, he moved to the Jahrom County s Khafr District [in Fars Province]
    and proselytized the Baha i faith there for 12 years. He was forced to
    leave the region, however, due to persecution by the people of the
    district, and moved to Takht-e Jamshid village where he opened a
    traditional/herbal medicine store, and began work as an herbalist and
    apothecary. Fifteen years later, he moved to the town of Marvdasht and
    lived there until his death. Mr. Sarvestani was a member of the Baha is
    National Board of Consultation (National Convention)* for 15 years. People
    close to him describe him as a courageous, resolute and unwavering
    individual, and an example of a true human being. (Borumand Center
    interview). The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    Baha i religious community is the largest minority group in Iran, with
    approximately 300,000 members in 1979 (more current figures are not
    available).** The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected Baha
    is religious to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of
    their most fundamental human rights. The Baha i religion is not recognized
    under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities
    refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha is have been denied the
    rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot
    profess and practice their faith and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence. *** Arrest and detention Mr. Sabet Sarvestani received a
    summons from the Shiraz Revolutionary Court on December 1, 1982, in which
    he had been told to appear before the Revolutionary Court s Assistant
    Prosecutor s Office Branch 5 on December 4, 1982, as a defendant , in
    order to provide certain explanations and clarifications . (Documentation
    available at the Boroumand Center). Mr. Sabet Sarvestani was arrested on
    December 4, 1982, when he went to the Shiraz Revolutionary Court, and was
    taken to the Shiraz Revolutionary Guards detention center. He was
    transferred to Shiraz Adelabad Prison 6 months later. (Archives of Baha i
    Persecution in Iran website). According to available information, Mr.
    Sabet Sarvestani did not have access to an attorney. He could hardly walk
    due to old age, and suffered from diabetes and severe shortness of breath;
    he was in need of medical attention. In seven months of detention,
    however, he was deprived of access to medical services and to his
    medication, and prison authorities did not allow him to be transferred to
    the hospital. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran website).
    Furthermore, signs of torture were perfectly visible on his body.
    (Boroumand Center interview, Bahainews TV). Mr. Sabet Sarvestani was
    allowed visitations with his family during detention. These visitations
    took place once a week and were in the form of cabin visitation from
    behind a glass divider. Only four members of his family were allowed at a
    time inside the prison. His family s last visitation occurred in late June
    1983; he was wheelchair bound at that point. Trial Shiraz Revolutionary
    Court s Assistant Prosecutor s Office Branch 5, adjudicated Mr. Sabet
    Sarvestani s charges. There is no information regarding the dates and the
    details of trial session(s). Charges According to the person interviewed
    by the Boroumand Center, there were no other charges against Mr. Sabet
    Sarvestani than being Baha i . The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt There is no indication
    of what evidence and documentation, if
