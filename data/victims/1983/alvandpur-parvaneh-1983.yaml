    Ms. Parvaneh Alvandpur is one of the 1,533 executed prisoners listed by
    the Association of Iranian Women of Köln (Germany). The list published in
    1997 is entitled: "A partial list of names of women executed by the
    Islamic Republic of Iran." Moreover, Ms. Alvandpur is one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published in 1985 by Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. A person informed about
    Ms. Alvandpur’s case sent additional information via an electronic form to
    the Boroumand Foundation. According to this information, Ms. Alvandpur,
    daughter of Bahman, was born in Fuman. She had an Associate degree and was
    a high school literature teacher. She grew up in a middle class and open
    minded family, and was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.
    The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members’ interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah’s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization’s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders.* Arrest and detention According to the information sent by the
    electronic form, Ms. Alvandpur was arrested by plain clothes agents at a
    hotel in Tehran in the summer of 1981. She was first transferred to the
    Evin prison and then to Rasht, where she was finally allowed to have
    visitation with her family. Ms. Parvaneh Alvandpur was interrogated for
    three months and was denied the right to an attorney. Trial No information
    is available on Ms. Alvandpur’s trial. According to the information sent
    by the electronic form, she was tried in Rasht. Ms. Alvandpur was denied
    the right to be represented at her trial by an attorney and her family was
    not allowed to observe her trial. Charges According to the information
    sent by the electronic form, the charges against Ms. Alvandpur were
    announced as “armed opposition” and “waging a war against God.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against Ms. Alvandpur cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of Ms. Alvanpur’s execution did not provide
    any specific information on the evidence presented against her. Defense No
    information is available on Ms. Alvanpur’s defense. Judgment According to
    the electronic form, Ms. Alvandpur was hanged in Rasht on April 20, 1983.
    Based on the addendum to the Mojahed magazine, she was executed by a
    firing squad in May or June of 1982. *The exclusion of MKO members from
    government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses,
    in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities’ different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as “Hypocrites” and the
    Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers
    regularly during demonstrations and while distributing publications,
    leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO
    called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental
    officials and the government officials’ efforts to impeach their ally,
    President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called
    this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom
    confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of
    casualties that resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large
    number of demonstrators were arrested and executed in the f
