    Mr. Soheil (also spelled "Suhayl") Hushmand, a welder, is one of the 206
    Iranian Baha is listed in a 1999 report published by the Baha i
    International Community. The report, Iran s Secret Blueprint for the
    Destruction of a Religious Community , documents the persecutions of the
    members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is
    killed since 1978. Additional information was drawn from the newspaper
    Khabar-e Jonub , published in Shiraz (22 February 1983), and from various
    issues of the The Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XVIII, 1979-1983,
    Haifa 1986 or description of events as published in A Tribute to the
    Faithful by Mah Mihr Gulistanih, or Olya's Story by Olya Roohizadegan. The
    Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the
    Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious
    community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300
    thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution,
    depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion
    is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and
    Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have
    been denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority;
    they cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention On 17 September 1982 the
    authorities searched Mr. Hushmand s home and in his absence confiscated
    his books, photos and posters. He was arrested by the authorities at 8:30
    am on 7 October 1982 while waiting for his fianc e in front of the Sadi
    Hospital on Zand Street in Shiraz. The Baha i World reports that while he
    was in prison, he was subjected to interrogations and torture. In
    addition, because of his religious beliefs, prison authorities considered
    him to be an unbeliever, and thus "unclean," and he was subjected to
    humiliating treatment similar to that of atheist political
    prisoners.Prison wardens refused to have any physical contact with the
    prisoner even when, for example, they were guiding the blindfolded
    prisoner to the interrogation room. In such case guards would give him the
    end of a folded newspaper and hold the other end, avoiding contact. He was
    kept at the Adelabad Prison until his execution. (A Tribute to the
    Faithful, p. 160) Trial The authorities provided no details about Mr.
    Hushmand s trial to his family. However, according to reports by the the
    Baha i World , authorities informed the defendant that he would be
    subjected to four sessions in which he would be given the opportunity to
    recant his faith and accept Islam. He was informed that if he did not sign
    a prepared statement rejecting Baha ism, he would be killed. It is unclear
    if all these sessions took place and whether or not these sessions
    replaced a trial. Charges The text of the indictment was not provided to
    Mr. Hushmand s family. However, the available information indicates that
    the charges against the defendant related to his religious beliefs. While
    in detention, the defendant was interrogated and pressured to recant
    his/her faith. Further, in an interview published in the Newspaper
    Khabar-e Jonub the religious judge, head of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Shiraz, in charge of the case, warned the Baha is to embrace
    dear Islam and recant Baha ism, which is rationally and logically doomed,
    before it is too late . Because of the unanimous international
    condemnation of the persecution of this quietist (apolitical) religious
    community, Iranian authorities do not always admit that the Baha'is are
    being punished for their religious beliefs. Therefore, judicial
    authorities have often wrongfully charged Baha'is with offenses such as
    "being involved in counter-revolutionary activities," "having supported
    the former regime," "being agents of Zionism," or "being involved with
    prostitution, adultery, and immorality." Evidence of guilt No information
    is available on the evidence presented against the def
