    Mr. Manuchehr Salahshur (elementary school teacher, Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization) is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in
    1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. The Razmandegan Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded in the winter of 1979. Its activities were focused on
    the working class and factories. The founding tenets of Razmandegan
    included the rejection of armed struggle and a strong stand against the
    pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. It viewed the Soviet Union
    as a “Social imperialist” state and believed that China had deviated from
    the Marxist-Leninist principles. Razmandegan was among the groups that
    became known as Khat-e Se (Third line). By early 1981, disagreements on
    the Party’s position on the Iran-Iraq war caused internal splits in
    Razmandegan. These splits, which coincided with the massive and brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government, caused the
    Organization to disband. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge brought against the
    defendant is not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Salahshur’s defense.
    Judgment There is no information on the verdict leading to this execution.
