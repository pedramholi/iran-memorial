    The information regarding Mr. Morteza Laqa i s execution was sent to Omid
    via an electronic form by a person familiar with this case. Mr. Laqa i, a
    member of the Peykar Organization, was studying agriculture at University.
    He is remembered for both his love of philosophy and strong commitment to
    his ideology. Mr. Laqa'i's name is also one of the 430 individuals whose
    name appears on "The Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation
    of the Working Class" in the andishevapeykar website. The list includes
    members of the party who were killed following the 1979 revolution. More
    than 400 of these individuals were executed. The Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of the
    Peykar Organization included the rejection of the guerrilla struggle and a
    strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies embraced by the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and the split within
    the Peykar during 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization
    and scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, the Peykar Organization no
    longer existed. Arrest and detention Based on the available information,
    Mr. Laqa i and his friend were arrested around noon during September,
    1982, at Meydan Shush in Tehran, on the suspicion that he participated in
    an anti-revolutionary political organization. He was first taken to the
    local Committee and shortly thereafter jailed at Evin Prison. He was
    detained for 11 months. During the first eight months he was allowed
    visits with his family. The prisoners were separated from their families
    by a glass window during the visits. After seven months in prison Mr. Laqa
    i s political activities were revealed, but it is unclear how the
    authorities discovered this information. Following that discovery, Mr.
    Laqa'i was denied any visitation from his family. He had no access to an
    attorney during his detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges There is no information regarding the charges
    brought against this defendant. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Laqa'i's defense. Judgment The details of
    this defendant s sentencing are not known. Mr. Laqa i was executed at Evin
    Prison. The authorities did not return the body to the family but informed
    the family in August that he was executed and gave them the name of the
    cemetery (Khavaran Cemetery) and the grave number.
