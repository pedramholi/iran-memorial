    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Hossein Jalalinia, along with nine others,
    was announced in a communiqu from the Islamic Revolution s Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Sistan and Baluchestan. This communiqu was reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami Daily on November 3, 1983. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this communiqu , Mr. Jalalinia was charged with being
    consistently involved in drug dealing and distributing, holding shares and
    participating in the purchase of 86 kg of opium. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Jalalinia's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolution s Public Prosecutor s
    Office in Sistan and Baluchestan sentenced Mr. Jalalinia to death. Having
    been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out.
