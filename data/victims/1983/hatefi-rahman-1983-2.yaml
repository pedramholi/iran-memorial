    The information about Mr. Rahman Hatefi (penname: Heydar Mehregan) was
    collected from the following sources: the book entitled, The Martyrs of
    the Tudeh Party of Iran by the Tudeh Party Publications, an article by Mr.
    Sadroddin Elahi (posted on the Rooz website on July 24, 2008), an article
    by Mr. Soheil Asefi (posted on the Asr-e Nou website on February 7, 2009)
    and the Farsi Wikipedia page about Mr. Hatefi. Mr. Hatefi was a prominent
    journalist and a political activist. Arrested in 1966, he spent almost one
    year at the Qezel Qal eh prison (an old prison located in a northern area
    of Tehran City, which was destroyed in 1971 and turned into a public
    square). Mr. Hatefi was arrested again in 1971 and released the following
    year. Mr. Hatefi became a member of the Tudeh Party in 1973. He
    established the Azarakhsh group (an underground group affiliated with the
    Tudeh party) as well as the Navid publication (affiliated with the Tudeh
    party) and also cooperated with Peyk-e Iran (a radio station affiliated
    with the Tudeh party, broadcast from West Germany and later from
    Bulgaria). Mr. Hatefi was also on the editorial board of the Kayhan
    newspaper. At the time of the 1979 Revolution, he played an important role
    in the publication of this newspaper. He was dismissed from his job with
    the newspaper during the purges in the spring of 1979. A former colleague,
    Mr. Elahi, described Mr. Hatefi as a journalist who mastered
    professionalism through his own experience. He knew the value of news
    stories and the right titles He was brilliant and talented; he was
    familiar with the important minor details and every aspect of good
    journalism He had no competition when it came to the design of pages, the
    wording of titles, and picture selection. Mr. Asefi quotes another
    colleague saying: Rahman Hatefi had a good reputation and [was] kind. He
    was one of a kind. He always joked and even when I was young, he greeted
    me, saying how are you, old man? No one holds a grudge against him. The
    Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh s ideology was Marxist
    Leninist and it supported the former Soviet Union s policies. The Party
    played a major role in Iran's political scene until it was banned for a
    second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution,
    the Tudeh party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic
    regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the
    new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of its attacks starting in 1982, when most of the Party
    s leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention Mr. Hatefi was
    arrested on April 27, 1983 in Tehran. He was taken to the Tohid Detention
    Center (previously known as the Joint Anti-Sabotage Committee). The
    details of Mr. Hatefi s detention and interrogation are not known. He was
    reportedly subjected to enforced disappearance in prison. According to his
    co-defendants, he died due to torture sometime between April 27 and July
    10, 1982. The Joint Anti-Sabotage Committee, established during the
    Monarchy, consisted mostly of solitary cells and was used for
    interrogation and torture. In the 1980 s, it was used for the same
    purposes but under new a name, Tohid, and was later renamed again as Ward
    3000. Since the late 1990 s, it has become the Ebrat museum. Trial There
    is no information regarding this trial. Charges The charges brought
    against the defendant are not known. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available concerning Mr. Hatefi s defense. Judgment Mr.
    Hatefi was killed in 1983. He is buried at Khavaran cemetery. Most leftist
    persons who were executed and buried at Khavaran are buried as unknown
    individuals and the exact location of the grave is unknown to their
    families.
