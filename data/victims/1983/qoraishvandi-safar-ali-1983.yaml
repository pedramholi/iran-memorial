    Information about Mr. Safar ali Qoraishvandi, son of Amirqoli, is based on
    an electronic form and several emails sent to Omid by a person familiar
    with his case. According to this information, he was born in Haftkel,
    Masjed-e Soleiman in 1950. He was a livestock technician working at the
    Jahad Keshavarzi (Agricultural Jihad) office. After the Revolution, he was
    detained for few months for his political activities. He was a sympathizer
    of the Sarbedaran (Ettehadieh Komonist-ha) group. The Ettehadieh
    Komonist-ha was created by exiled opponents of the Pahlavi regime who
    mostly belonged to the Student Confederation. They followed the teachings
    of Mao Tse-Tung but did not believe in guerilla warfare. The group became
    marked by ideological divisions during the period preceding and following
    the 1979 revolution, which caused it to split into several factions. One
    of the most important rifts was triggered by the decision of a number of
    members to take up arms and take over a city in Iran. The uprising plan,
    devised in the midst of an active and violent anti-communist campaign by
    the revolutionary Islamic government, split the Ettehadieh in two
    factions: one believed in the armed movement and the other opposed it. In
    the winter of 1982, armed members of the Ettehadieh hid in a forest in the
    North of Iran ( Jangal in Farsi) outside the city of Amol. This group,
    also known as the Jangal Group, was involved in several clashes with the
    Revolutionary Guards and, ultimately, on January 26, attacked the city of
    Amol hoping to generate a general uprising. The attempt to seize Amol
    failed. It is reported that a number of the group s members, Revolutionary
    Guards, and civilians were killed during the Amol clash. Subsequently,
    members of the Ettehadieh , including those who opposed the Amol uprising,
    were arrested and tried for belonging to the organization and for having
    participated in the Amol clash. Arrest and detention According to the
    information sent to Omid , after his participation in Amol clashes, Mr.
    Safar ali Qoraishvandi escaped to Kerman, where he was exposed by a
    relative and arrested after hiding in a house for ten days in 1982. He was
    transferred to Masjed-e Soleiman. His family could visit him from the
    bottom of a 4 meters wall weekly. His wife was also able to visit him in
    person. During one such visitation, she witnessed that two guards were
    carrying Mr. Qoraishvandi to the visitation place. He was tortured
    (lashed) so severely that he could not walk. According to this report, he
    was pressured to confess in a televised show and he had refused. Trial No
    information is available on Safar ali Qoraishvandi s trial. According to
    the information sent to Omid , he was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Masjed-e Soleiman. Charges No information is available on Safar
    ali Qoraishvandi s charges. According to the information sent to Omid , he
    was charged for participation in armed clashes with security forces. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Safar ali
    Qoraishvandi. Defense No information is available about Safar ali
    Qoraishvandi s defense. According to the information sent to Omid , he was
    denied the right to access a defense attorney. Judgment According to the
    information sent to Omid , Mr. Safar ali Qoraishvandi was executed in
    Masjed-e Soleiman on December 25, 1983. A few days later, authorities
    called and summoned his father-in-law to the court. They informed him of
    Mr. Qoraishvandi s execution and gave him an address at a cemetery in
    Masjed-e Soleiman. They also warned him not to hold any memorial ceremony.
    When Mr. Qoraishvandi s mother expressed her feelings, the officials
    cuffed her hands, tied her feet, taped her mouth, and detained her for
    several hours. Mr. Qoraishvandi s house was regularly observed and checked
    by Revolutionary Guards afterwards. His tomb stone was broken many times,
    and the family was denied his benefits from the Agricultural Office.
