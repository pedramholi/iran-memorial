    The execution of Mr. Ali Mohammad Tulabi was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on October 11, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Tulabi was
    reportedly charged with kidnapping and murder of a five-year-old. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Tulabi's defense. Judgment The Criminal
    Court of Khoram Abad sentenced Mr. Tulabi to death. Having been confirmed
    by the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out in public.
