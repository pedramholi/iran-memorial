    was announced in a communiqu from the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. This communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri

    actively involved in the purchase and distribution of heroin, possessing
    2.60 kg of heroin when arrested, establishing an international
    drug-trafficking gang, and having a previous record of purchasing and
    distributing heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Rigi s
    defense. Judgment One of the tribunals of the Anti-Narcotics Section of
    the Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran sentenced Mr. Rigi to death. The
    sentence was carried out at dawn.
