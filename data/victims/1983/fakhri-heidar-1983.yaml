    The execution of Mr. Heidar Fakhri, along with two others, was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily on November 7, 1983. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Fakhri who was reportedly involved in an
    armed robbery gang had been the expelled police officer from Tehran
    Shahrbani (police forces). He had been convicted to 4-year imprisonment
    before and had escaped from prison during the victory of the revolution.
    He, along with two others, was also reported to be charged with banditry
    and highway robbery on the roads to Tehran, Qom, Esfahan, Rafsanjan,
    Kerman, Zahedan and Qazvin-Karaj highway; battery and tying the passengers
    with ropes, threatening and escaping from Moshkabad police station in Arak
    and firing at police officers and martyring the police station commander
    in Arak, highway robbery and murder, car robbery as well as battery with
    knife. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought
    trumped up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Fakhri s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Arak sentenced Mr. Fakhri to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Islamic Revolutionary Supreme Court, the sentence was
    carried out.
