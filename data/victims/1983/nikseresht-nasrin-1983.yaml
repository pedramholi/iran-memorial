    Information about Ms. Nasrin Nikseresht has been drawn from an electronic
    form that a former cellmate has sent to Omid. Ms. Nikseresht was married.
    Her husband, Rahim Saburi, was one of the founders of the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization (The Ashraf Dehqani branch) who was killed in clashes with
    the Islamic police in the winter of 1981. Ms. Nikseresht was also a member
    of the same Organization. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist
    Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla
    movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups
    opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Revolution, the
    Organization renounced armed struggle, but some of the former members who
    remained faithful to guerilla combat formed an independent Fadaiyan Khalq
    Guerilla group, known as the Ashraf Dehqani branch. Arrest and detention
    According to the form, Ms. Nikseresht was arrested in 1984 and imprisoned
    in Evin prison. She was detained at Unit 6 of the 209 ward of Evin prison.
    This section was known for its solitary confinements, interrogation rooms
    and a basement used for torture. Ms. Nikseresht was denied a lawyer,
    access to the file containing her alleged charges, and visitation with her
    family. Other inmates had seen her in a wheelchair with her legs bandaged.
    One of the repentant prisoners who had seen Ms. Nikseresht during an
    interrogation recalled that she had not divulged the secrets that she knew
    and had defended her political beliefs and was praised by other leftist
    prisoners for her bravery. Except for a short period during her
    detainment, Ms. Nikeseresht was kept in solitary confinement. Trial There
    is no information regarding this trial. Charges The charges brought
    against the defendant are not known. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available concerning Ms. Nikseresht’s defense. Judgment
    No specific information is available about the verdict leading to this
    execution. Ms. Nikseresht was executed at Evin prison in 1983.
