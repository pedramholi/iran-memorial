    Mrs. Mary Metni was one of 63 victims of the bombing of the American
    Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, which took place on April 18, 1983. At
    approximately 1:05 PM, a truck loaded with nearly 2,000 pounds of
    explosives careened through the driveway of the American embassy and
    crashed into the building. A massive explosion ripped through all seven
    levels of the embassy, sending debris flying hundreds of feet into the air
    and causing the burning building to collapse on itself. In addition to
    those who lost their lives, at least 120 people were injured. At the time,
    it was the deadliest attack on an American diplomatic mission since World
    War II. Mrs. Metni was born in Alexandria, Egypt on January 10, 1914 to an
    Orthodox Christian family; she spent most of her childhood and adolescence
    in Lebanon. A gifted student, she studied at the American University in
    Beirut (AUB) and was fluent in English, French, Arabic, and Spanish (she
    later studied Russian). In 1939 she married Spiridon Metni, a registered
    pharmacist of New York State who opened the first American drug-store and
    soda-fountain in Beirut. About ten years later, Mrs. Metni began working
    for the American embassy, where she had a long and distinguished career as
    an economic and commercial analyst. Her colleagues praised her loyalty and
    dedication she often took work home as well as her excellent memory. When
    people around the embassy forgot information and phone numbers, they often
    called Mrs. Metni. Mrs. Metni was a talented seamstress and was known for
    making beautiful dresses for her daughters. She liked entertaining guests
    at her home, and baked muffins and biscuits in quantities that baffled her
    neighbors. Mrs. Metni was a generous, optimistic woman wholly dedicated to
    her friends and family. As a relative said of her, She was rather jolly
    and witty, and she taught her children to take life with irony and make
    the best of it. Mrs. Metni retired from the American embassy in 1979 after
    thirty years of service. In 1983, she was re-employed by the embassy on a
    short contract basis, to help plan a visit by a U.S. delegation.
    Tragically, that one-month contract ran from mid-March to late April 1983.
    On the day of the embassy bombing, April 18, Mrs. Metni was in the
    cafeteria, in a stairway adjacent to where the car bomb hit. She suffered
    massive internal injuries as a result of the blast, and passed away
    shortly after arriving at the hospital. She was 69 years old at the time
    of her death. Background Mrs.Metni is in Omid because of the overwhelming
    evidence connecting the Islamic Republic of Iran to the 1983 bombing at
    the American embassy in Beirut. This attack, claimed by a group called
    Islamic Jihad, was the first in a series of related bombings carried out
    in Lebanon between 1983 and 1984, which claimed at least 396 lives. In the
    early 1980s, Lebanon was a highly volatile country, home to conflicting
    military and political agendas and where the Islamic Republic exercised
    growing influence with the stated aim of spreading the Islamic Revolution.
    Already hostile to American influence in the Middle East and further
    angered by the United States military support of Iraq, Iran s foe in the
    Iran-Iraq war, the Islamic Republic s leaders became exasperated when,
    following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the summer of 1982, the
    United States brokered a Lebanese-Israeli truce and deployed a large
    contingent of American servicemen in the framework of a Multinational
    Peacekeeping Force. Islamic Jihad was a heretofore little-noticed group
    known only for a string of grenade attacks launched on French, Italian,
    and American members of the Multinational Force in March of 1983. When it
    claimed responsibility for the embassy bombing, Islamic Jihad declared
    that the attack was part of the Iranian revolution s campaign against
    imperialist targets throughout the world. The group promised that We shall
    keep striking at any imperialist presence in Lebanon, including the
    Multinational Force. (Two massive bomb attacks against American and French
    servicemen indeed followed on October 23, 1983). Islamic Jihad was a
    shadowy subset of Hezbollah (Party of God), a radical, armed Shi ite
    organization with deep ideological and organizational ties to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. As early as August of 1979, Iran s Supreme Leader,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, had alluded to the establishment of a Party of God
    that would unite Muslims around the goal of resisting American and Israeli
    designs for the Middle East. So far, the oppressed have been disunited and
    nothing happens through disunity. Now that an example of the unity of the
    downtrodden has materialized in the land of Muslims [the Islamic
    Revolution], this example will have to be applied in a wider context, to
    encompass all humanity, through the establishment of a Party of the
    Downtrodden, which is the same as the Party of God [ Hezbollah ], and
    which is in line with the exalted will of God Past mistakes must be
    rectified through Muslim unity an
