    The information about Mr. Mas’ud Purkarim was published in the Peykar
    magazine (No. 45, March 3, 1980). An edited volume by Mihan Rusta et al
    Inescapable Escape (Berkeley: 2008) also reports the execution. Mr.
    Purkarim is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of
    “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains
    the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. According to Peykar , Mr. Purkarim was born in Bandar
    Anzali in 1947. He started his political activity with the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1971. He joined the Marxist Faction during the ideological
    change of this organization. In 1974, he participated in some military
    operations such as the explosion operation objecting to Soltan Qabus’s
    travel to Iran, and the Omran Bank explosion. He continued his activity
    with the Peykar Organization from 1977. He was the Peykar candidate for
    Bandar Anzali during the parliamentary election. Mr. Purkarim was a
    candidate for parliamentary election, a member of the central committee of
    the Peykar, and in charge of the Tabriz Committee. Mr. Abbas Kayqobadi,
    who was Mr. Purkarim’s cellmate in October of 1983, states that the latter
    was very thin, and as a result of torture, his kidneys collapsed. He
    underwent dialysis. He had a strong morale. He was quiet most of the time;
    but when he spoke he spoke of hope and consoled other prisoners. In
    prison, many political prisoners acted in concert with comrades of their
    own political organization. But Mr. Purkarim was an exception; he did not
    limit himself to follow organizational behaviors at the expense of other
    political prisoners ( Inescapable Escape ). The Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No
    information is available on Mr. Purkarim’s charges. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Purkarim’s defense. Judgment According to the report of
    his cellmate, Mr. Mas’ud Purkarim, along with Mr. Ali Shakeri, a Fadaiyan
    Khalq sympathizer, was taken for execution on January 1, 1984. No further
    information is available about the execution.
