    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to this report, Mr. Aqa Salehi Qarehshirvan had pleaded guilty
    to his crimes and confessed to be a nonaddict. Defense No information is

    of the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor s Office declared
    Mr. Aqa Salehi Qarehshirvan a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to
