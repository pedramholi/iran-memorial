    The information about Mr. Mohammad Reza Separghami has been sent to Omid,
    via an electronic form, by an individual familiar with this case. This
    execution was also reported in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    12028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The
    execution of Mr. Separghami, a member of the Ettehadieh Komonist-ha, along
    with 21 others, was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on January 27,
    1983. The report quotes the public relations of the Islamic Revolution’s
    Public Prosecutor’s Office in Tehran. The information about his charges
    and defenses was published in the same newspaper on January 11, 1983.
    According to the electronic form, Mr. Separghami was born in
    October/November 1953 in Amol (Mazandaran province). He was a husband and
    a father, and studied computer science in a university. The Ettehadieh
    Komonist-ha (the Union of Communists of Iran) was created by exiled
    opponents of the Pahlavi regime who mostly belonged to the Student
    Confederation. They followed the teachings of Mao Tse-Tung and did not
    believe in guerilla warfare. The group became marked by ideological
    divides during the periods preceding and following the 1979 revolution
    which caused it to split into several factions. One of the most important
    rifts was triggered by the decision by a number of members to take up arms
    and take over a city in Iran. The uprising plan, devised in the midst of
    an active and violent anti-communist campaign by the revolutionary Islamic
    government, split the Union in two factions: one supporting the armed
    movement and the other opposing it. In the winter of 1982, armed members
    of the Union hid in a forest in the North of Iran (Jangal in Farsi)
    outside the city of Amol. This group, also known as the Sarbedaran-e
    Jangal , was involved in several clashes with the Revolutionary guards and
    ultimately, on January 26, attacked the city of Amol hoping to generate a
    general uprising. The attempt to seize Amol failed. It is reported that a
    number of the group’s members, revolutionary guards, and civilians were
    killed during the Amol clash. Subsequently, members of the Union,
    including those who opposed the Amol uprising, were arrested and tried for
    belonging to the organization and for having participated in the Amol
    clash. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial According to this report Mr. Separghami
    was tried along with 28 or 29 others between January 9 and 15, 1983. The
    trial took place at the First Division of the Islamic Revolutionary Public
    Prosecutor’s Office in Tehran. Charges Mr. Separghami’s indictment was
    read to him by Tehran’s Public Prosecutor. The text of this indictment is
    as follows: “being a member in the Union of Communists of Iran, being in
    charge of Tehran Committee in the Union, being a member of the
    decision-making council of Sarbedaran-e Jangal …and being in charge of the
    political wing of Mostafa Rahbar group in the forest.” He was also charged
    with “direct participation in the clashes on November 13 with the members
    of the Revolutionary Guards and the Army in the forest in which tens of
    them were martyred, direct participation in Razkeh clashes in December
    1981…and attacking Amol in which he was armed with G3 rifles and serahi”
    (a kind of explosive)…It was also reported that “he was in charge of
    identifying the forest outskirts…and had provided the members of the Union
    with his parents’ house until launching the attack ;that is, for 24
    hours.” The Islamic Revolution’s Public Prosecutor’s Office contended that
    Mr. Separghami’s culpability was indisputable and therefore asked for the
    maximum penalty possible. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt It is mentioned in the
    report, that Mr. Separghami had admitted to having participated in the
    operation which cost the lives of 12 persons. Defense According to the
    report, Mr. Separghami did not mention much in his defense. He just stated
    that: “We were led to believe by the heads of the Organization that we
    only needed to spark the fire that already existed in Amol, that once we
    went to Amol and other cities people would welcome us with open arms.”
    Judgment The First Division of the Islamic Revolutionary Public
    Prosecutor’s Office in Tehran sentenced Mr. Separghami to death. Mr.
    Mohammad Reza Separghami was shot by a firing squad at 9 p.m. on January
    25, 1983 in Evin prison.
