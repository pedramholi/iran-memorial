    The information about Mr. Hassan Hosseinpur Tabrizi is taken from the book
    The Tudeh Martyrs , copyright 2001 by the Tudeh Party of Iran
    Publications. He was born in Baku and when he was five years old his
    family migrated to Iran. After finishing elementary school, he went to the
    city of Veresk and worked for the Railroad Company. In 1943, he joined the
    Tudeh Party. After the party was made illegal in 1948, he went to the
    south and became a leader in the workers' strikes. He went overseas to
    continue his studies when the coup of August 19, 1953 occurred. During
    this coup the royalists overthrew President Mossadeq and the Shah returned
    to Iran. On his return, Mr. Hosseinpur Tabrizi was arrested in Beirut and
    was extradited to Iran and imprisoned for his affiliation to the Tudeh
    Party. In 1957, he was released from prison. After years of being a
    worker, in 1971, he was selected as the Official Chief of the Iran Metal
    Industries. He was a self-educated man and a poet. In private sessions, he
    taught philosophy, political economy, and theoretical socialism. The Tudeh
    Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh's ideology was
    Marxist-Leninist and it supported the former Soviet Union's policies. The
    Party played a major role in Iran's political scene until it was banned
    for the second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979
    Revolution, the Tudeh Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic
    Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively
    supported the new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic
    Republic, it became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of
    the Party's leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The

    severely that he could not chew his food, so I had to chew the food and
    put it in his mouth. He was almost dead two or three times when they took
    him to the hospital." According to the same source, the last time they
    took him to the hospital, there were marks of torture all over his body.
