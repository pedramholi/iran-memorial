    The information about Mr. Mohammad Sadeq Qa edi has been drawn from an
    interview with his sister. He is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Mr. Qa edi was born in Rasht in 1951. He earned his
    master s degree from the School of Business. He was an opponent of the
    monarchy and went underground in 1975 joining the Marxist faction of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization, which later became the Peykar Organization.
    Before his arrest, he worked at the labor division of the latter
    Organization. His brother and sister-in-law, Mr. Mohammad Javad Qa edi and
    Monirossadat Hashemi, have also been executed. The Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to the available information, there was no arrest warrant. On
    June 9, 1982, the Revolutionary Guards surrounded their home in Tehran.
    Mr. Qa edi s brother left the house to make a call from the public phone.
    He was arrested. Soon his wife, who was worried that he had not returned
    home, left the house to look for him and she was arrested as well. Then
    the agents of the Revolutionary Guards raided the house and arrested Mr.
    Mohammad Sadeq Qa edi, who was asleep at the time, along with his sister.
    All four were taken to the Joint Committee in the same vehicle. According
    to his sister, Mr. Mohammad Sadeq Qa edi was tortured severely during
    seven months of detention. Mr. Qa edi was detained at the Joint Committee
    until November or December 1982 and then transferred to Evin prison.
    There, he had one or two visits with his mother. Before the transfer, he
    had a visit with his sister. She described this visit saying: Just a few
    minutes before his transfer to Evin, I was allowed to visit him. He was
    worried about me since I was badly ill. He had no news of my other
    brother, Javad. He had a short trial and he told me that was the last time
    they saw each other. The interrogators, who were present during the visit,
    made fun of us. They told him: Ask your sister if she was raped! Referring
    to a slogan of the Peykar Organization, they said: Khomeini, flogging, and
    execution. You ve been flogged, now it s time for execution. Trial There
    is no known detail regarding this trial, except that Mr. Qa edi was tried
    at the Joint Committee in November or December 1982. Charges According to
    the interviewee, Mr. Qa edi was charged with membership of the Peykar
    Organization and being a communist. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available concerning Mr. Qa edi s defense. He was denied
    access to his file and an attorney. Judgment Mr. Mohammad Sadeq Qa edi was
    condemned to death. He was executed by firing squad on February 19, 1983
    at Evin prison.
