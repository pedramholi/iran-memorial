    Information about the murder of Mr. Bahman Dehqani, son of Haji Mohammad
    and Zoha Beygom Dehqani and father of seven children, was obtained from
    documents published in the Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran (ABPI),
    including a letter written to His Excellency Ayatollah Haj Abbas Izadi by
    Mr. Dehqani s sibling Account of attack on Bahman Dehqani s house and his
    murder (November 21st, 1983), a biography published on November 19th,
    1983, and information from The Baha i World, International Survey of
    Current Baha i Activities'' Volume 19 (1983-1986). Additional background
    informaiton was obtained from an interview with Hojjat-al Islam Ebrahim
    Shiasi, a Muslim preacher, published in Hawza News (Februaey 25th, 2015).
    Mr. Bahman Dehqani is also one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1999
    report published by the Baha i International Community. The report, Iran s
    Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious Community , documents
    the persecutions of the members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of
    Iran and lists the Baha is killed since 1978. (See also:
    www.question.bahai.org ). Additional information has been drawn from
    various issues of The Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986,
    Haifa 1994. The small village of Mohammadieh Karvan is located in Tiran
    and Karvan Country in Isfahan Province, with a population between 1154
    (2006 Census) and 1500 (Local Cleric, Hawza News). The Baha i population
    reportdely makes up 15% of the total count, which is seemingly an issue
    taken up by the Shi a clergy, who have been conducting efforts to convert
    the Baha is and promote Islam. Mr. Bahman Dehqani was born on January 3rd,
    1941 to a Baha i family in the village of Mohammadieh Karvan, outside of
    Najafabad in Isfahan (ABPI, Baha i World). He had an elementary education
    and owned a business in his village before becoming a farmer and working
    on his own farm (ABPI, Baha i World). Mr. Dehqani married his wife in 1964
    and the couple had seven children (Baha i World). He served on the Local
    Spiritual Assembly of Mohammadieh Karvan until he was murdered. The Baha
    is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the
    Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious
    community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300
    thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution,
    depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion
    is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and
    Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have
    been denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority;
    they cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Baha i National Spiritual Assembly After the
    Islamic Revolution In the organizational structure of the Baha i
    community, the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly is a body
    composed of nine individuals that are elected annually with the votes of
    adult Baha is in each country. This institution tends to the affairs and
    issues of the Baha i community on the national level. The National
    Spiritual Assembly has the responsibility of guiding, coordinating, and
    moving forward the activities of each country s local spiritual
    assemblies, and establishing contact with Beit-al-Adl ( House of Justice
    ), the international council of the Baha i faith, the highest
    decision-making authority in the world Baha i community. The Bah I s
    Spiritual Assemblies were gradually suppressed. In Baha I s literature,
    the first assemply whose members were kidnapped is commonly known as the
    First National Assembly. In 1980 and 1981, the First, Second, and Third
    National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as local Baha i spiritual
    assemblies in various cities, including Tehran, Yazd, Hamedan, and Tabriz,
    were severely persecuted and the majority of their members were executed.
