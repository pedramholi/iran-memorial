    He had retired from work at the National Oil Co., settling into the family
    home in Shiraz, where Baha i books and papers aided his participation in
    the Local Spiritual Assembly. Mr. Enayatollah Eshraqi (also spelled
    "Inayatu'llah Ishraqi"), a retired employee of the Iranian National Oil
    Company and member of the marriage counseling committee and Local
    Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is in Shiraz, is one of the 206 Iranian
    Baha is listed in a 1999 report published by the Baha i International
    Community. The report, Iran s Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a
    Religious Community , documents the persecutions of the members of the
    Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since
    1978. Additional information was drawn from the newspaper Khabar-e Jonub ,
    published in Shiraz (22 February 1983), and from various issues of the The
    Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XVIII, 1979-1983, Haifa 1986 or
    description of events as published in A Tribute to the Faithful by Mah
    Mihr Gulistanih, or Olya's Story by Olya Roohizadegan and A Congressional
    Hearing in World Order Magazine, Winter 1983-1984 edition and a letter
    written by Mr. Eshraqi to his family outside of Iran on 29/11/1981. Mr.
    Eshraqi was first arrested along with his wife and two daughters in 1981
    (Olya's Story p. 173 World Order p. 36). On Tuesday, 24 November 1981,
    their home was searched by revolutionary guards and their Baha'i books and
    papers were all confiscated. The next day, around 12 noon, all four
    members of the Eshraqi family and their two houseguests were arrested and
    taken to the Sepah [Revolutionary Guards headquarters]. Around Friday noon
    their interrogations took place and by late afternoon, they were released.
    The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of
    the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious
    community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300
    thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution,
    depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion
    is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and
    Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have
    been denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority;
    they cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention Mr. Eshraqi was arrested
    for the second time along with his wife and daughter around 8:30 pm on 29
    November 1982 at his home in Shiraz. He was taken to the Sepah Detention
    Centre, was processed and a bail of 10 Million Rials was set for him,
    which he refused to provide unless his wife and daughter could also be
    freed. Because of his religious beliefs, the prison authorities considered
    him to be an unbeliever, and thus "unclean", and he was subjected to
    humiliating treatment similar to that of atheist political prisoners.
    Prison wardens refused to have any physical contact with the prisoner even
    when, for example, they were guiding the blindfolded prisoner to the
    interrogation room. In such case guards would give him the end of a folded
    newspaper and hold the other end, avoiding contact. On 12 January 1983 he
    was transferred to Adelabad prison. He remained in custody at Adelabad
    Prison until his execution. Mr. Eshraqi was allowed to see his wife and
    daughter, who remained in custody, once before his execution. (World Order
    p. 37) Trial There is no detail available about Mr. Eshraqi's trial.
    However, family visitors and former cellmates report that he had had been
    repeatedly interrogated by or under the supervision of the religious
    magistrate. According to reports by the the Baha i World , authorities
    informed the defendant that he would be subjected to four sessions in
    which he would be given the opportunity to recant his faith and accept
    Islam. He was informed that if he did not sign a prepared statement
    rejecting Baha ism, he would be killed. It is unclear if all these
    sessions took
