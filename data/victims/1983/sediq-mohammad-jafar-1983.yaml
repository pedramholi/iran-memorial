    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Jafar Sediq, along with eleven others, was

    of heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn

    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.

    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt According to this report, Mr. Sediq had pleaded
    guilty to make a living through armed robbery and sale of drugs. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Sediq's defense. Judgment The Tribunal
    of the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor s Office declared
    Mr. Sediq a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out.
