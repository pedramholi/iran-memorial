    The execution of Mr. Mahmud Khodaverdi, along with eleven others, was

    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Khodaverdi
    was reported to be charged with being actively involved in the production
    and distribution of heroin, transportation and sale of 139 gm of pure
    heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Khodaverdi's defense. Judgment The
    Tribunal of the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor s Office
    declared Mr. Khodaverdi a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death.
    Having been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out.
