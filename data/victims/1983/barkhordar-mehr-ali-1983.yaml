    The execution of Mr. Mehr Ali Barkhordar, along with sixteen others, was
    announced in a communiqu from the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami Daily on October 8, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Barkhordar was
    reportedly charged with establishing a drug trafficking gang, being
    actively involved in the purchase and distribution of narcotics,
    confessing to dealing 134 kg of opium over a period of time, possessing 1
    kg of narcotics and having been convicted previously several times. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Barkhordar's defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal in Tehran declared Mr. Barkhordar a corruptor on
    earth and sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme
    Court, the sentence was carried out at 5 a.m.
