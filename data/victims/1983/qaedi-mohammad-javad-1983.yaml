    The information about Mr. Mohammad Javad Qa’edi has been gathered from an
    interview with his sister. Also, Mr. Qa’edi is one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Qa’edi was born in
    Rasht in 1952. He enrolled at the Electronics Department of the Ariamehr
    University of Technology (renamed Sharif) in 1970. In the fall of 1972, he
    was imprisoned for six months subsequent to his participation in the
    demonstration against American President, Richard Nixon’s visit to Iran,
    which had taken place at the end of May 1972. Two or three months after
    his release, he joined the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and went
    underground. In 1975, following internal split in the Organization, he
    joined the Marxist faction. At the time of the Revolution, he continued
    his political activism at the Organization for the Achievement of the
    Objectives of the Working Class; he was one of the theoreticians of this
    Organization, which joined the Sahand Organization. Mr. Qa’edi’s wife,
    Monirossadat Hashemi, and his brother, Mohammad Qades Qa’edi, have also
    been executed. The Sahand Organization (or Ettehad-e Mobarezan-e
    Komonist”) was founded after the Islamic Revolution of February 1979, with
    a specific focus on ideology. Later Sahand developed the project of the
    Communist Party of Iran in 1982, and the Party was founded by Sahand and
    Komala and remainders of such Communist organizations as Peykar,
    Razmandegan, and some affiliates of the Fadaiyan Khalq. Komala in
    Kurdistan became the center of the Communist Party of Iran, whose main
    publication was the “Communist” monthly magazine. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Qa’edi was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards on June 9. 1982. According
    to the available information, there was no arrest warrant. On that date,
    he left the house to make a call from a public phone and was arrested on
    the street. Soon his wife, who was worried that he had not come back home,
    left the house to look for him and was also arrested. The same day, his
    brother and sister were arrested in the same house and all four of them
    taken to the Joint Committee in the same vehicle. Mr. Qa’edi was detained
    one year at the Joint Committee and about three months at Evin prison.
    During the first 24 hours after arrest, his sister saw him from under her
    blindfolds and she noticed that one of his feet was very swollen. In a
    visit with his sister in Mid-April 1983, he told her that he was kept in
    solitary confinement for almost a year and had been severely tortured; as
    a result his kidneys had failed, he had lost most of his teeth due to
    beatings, and he had skin fungus infection. In order to force him to
    repent his political beliefs and be interviewed and filmed, which would
    then be broadcast on television, the state agents flogged one of his feet
    for weeks and then flogged his other foot. Despite the torture, he refused
    to repent. At Evin prison, Mr. Qa’edi had one or two visits with his
    mother. A few weeks prior to his execution, he had an in-person visit with
    his sister. According to her testimony, during his detention at Evin he
    had a daily ration of flogging. On his day of execution, he told his wife
    in a visit that lasted for a few minutes that this was their last visit.
    He told his wife that his brother had been executed and he asked his wife
    to inform the rest of the family. Trial The trial took place in March or
    April of 1983 and reportedly only interrogators were present. The trial
    session lasted for four hours during which he was asked to have a
    television interview and speak against the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    and Marxism. Mr. Qa’edi refused. Charges Mr. Mohammad Javad Qa’edi was
    arrested for activism under the Shah’s regime, being a communist, and
    acting against the Islamic Republic. The charges brought against him
    during the tribunal are not known. However, from the fact that the
    presiding judge of the tribunal asked him about changing his ideology and
    the internal changes of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, it appears that
    one of his charges was apostasy. The interviewee believes that the reason
    he had a daily ration of flogging was the charge of apostasy. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Qa’edi’s defense. He was denied access
    to his file and the right to have an attorney. Judgment Mr. Qa’edi was
    condemned to death at the Joint Committee. In his last visit with his
    mother which took place some time before the execution, he told her:
