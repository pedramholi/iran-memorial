    Mr. Albert Votaw was one of 63 victims of the bombing of the American
    Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, which took place on April 18, 1983. At
    approximately 1:05 PM, a truck loaded with nearly 2,000 pounds of
    explosives careened through the driveway of the American embassy and
    crashed into the building. A massive explosion ripped through all seven
    levels of the embassy, sending debris flying hundreds of feet into the air
    and causing the burning building to collapse on itself. In addition to
    those who lost their lives, at least 120 people were injured. At the time,
    it was the deadliest attack on an American diplomatic mission since World
    War II. Mr. Votaw was born on August 16, 1925 in Chester, Pennsylvania, in
    a Quaker family. After high school, he attended Deep Springs College, in
    Deep Springs, California, where he also worked as a bartender, to the
    amusement of his brother considering their Quaker background. Mr. Votaw s
    brother recalled that Albert was known in school to be extraordinarily
    gifted, a high achiever who was very universal in his interests. Mr. Votaw
    s second wife remembered him as a very big man over 6 2 tall. He was
    always fun, she said, and had something of Errol Flynn in him. Mr. Votaw
    was drafted to fight in World War II, but, as a Quaker, he was a
    conscientious objector and hence volunteered as a study subject for
    various medical studies at Yale University. Following the end of World War
    II, Mr. Votaw earned an M.A. in Economics and Anthropology from the
    University of Chicago. After a stint as a reporter, he changed careers and
    became involved housing and urban development; he worked both in the
    United States and abroad, living in such countries as Tunisia, the Ivory
    Coast, and Thailand. Beginning with his stay in the Ivory Coast, Mr. Votaw
    became employed by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).
    In January 1983, Mr. Votaw was assigned by USAID to a new posting in
    Beirut, where he was to help with a major reconstruction effort. To his
    spouse s inquiry about the danger involved in living in Lebanon, Mr. Votaw
    responded: how many housing officers do you know who have died in the line
    of fire? Mr. Votaw arrived in Beirut eleven days before the bombing and
    was killed in the explosion. He was 57 years old at the time of his death.
    Background Mr. Votaw is in Omid because of the overwhelming evidence
    connecting the Islamic Republic of Iran to the 1983 bombing at the
    American embassy in Beirut. This attack, claimed by a group called Islamic
    Jihad, was the first in a series of related bombings carried out in
    Lebanon between 1983 and 1984, which claimed at least 396 lives. In the
    early 1980s, Lebanon was a highly volatile country, home to conflicting
    military and political agendas and where the Islamic Republic exercised
    growing influence with the stated aim of spreading the Islamic Revolution.
    Already hostile to American influence in the Middle East and further
    angered by the United States military support of Iraq, Iran s foe in the
    Iran-Iraq war, the Islamic Republic s leaders became exasperated when,
    following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the summer of 1982, the
    United States brokered a Lebanese-Israeli truce and deployed a large
    contingent of American servicemen in the framework of a Multinational
    Peacekeeping Force. Islamic Jihad was a heretofore little-noticed group
    known only for a string of grenade attacks launched on French, Italian,
    and American members of the Multinational Force in March of 1983. When it
    claimed responsibility for the embassy bombing, Islamic Jihad declared
    that the attack was part of the Iranian revolution s campaign against
    imperialist targets throughout the world. The group promised that We shall
    keep striking at any imperialist presence in Lebanon, including the
    Multinational Force. (Two massive bomb attacks against American and French
    servicemen indeed followed on October 23, 1983). Islamic Jihad was a
    shadowy subset of Hezbollah (Party of God), a radical, armed Shi ite
    organization with deep ideological and organizational ties to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. As early as August of 1979, Iran s Supreme Leader,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, had alluded to the establishment of a Party of God
    that would unite Muslims around the goal of resisting American and Israeli
    designs for the Middle East. So far, the oppressed have been disunited and
    nothing happens through disunity. Now that an example of the unity of the
    downtrodden has materialized in the land of Muslims [the Islamic
    Revolution], this example will have to be applied in a wider context, to
    encompass all humanity, through the establishment of a Party of the
    Downtrodden, which is the same as the Party of God [ Hezbollah ], and
    which is in line with the exalted will of God Past mistakes must be
    rectified through Muslim unity and the establishment of the Party of the
    Downtrodden against the great powers, led by the criminal America and its
    very corrupt stooge, Israel. * Punishing those who supported Iraq
