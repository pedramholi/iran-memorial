    Darwiche Rahi was one of 63 victims of the bombing of the American Embassy
    in Beirut, Lebanon, which took place on April 18, 1983. At approximately
    1:05 PM, a truck loaded with nearly 2,000 pounds of explosives careened
    through the driveway of the American embassy and crashed into the
    building. A massive explosion ripped through all seven levels of the
    embassy, sending debris flying hundreds of feet into the air and causing
    the burning building to collapse on itself. In addition to those who lost
    their lives, at least 120 people were injured. At the time, it was the
    deadliest attack on an American diplomatic mission since World War II. Mr.
    Rahi was the father of an eldest son and three daughters. He moved to
    Beirut from his birthplace of Himlaya, Lebanon as a young man. Mr. Rahi
    graduated from culinary school to quickly become general manager for some
    of the largest restaurants in Beirut and was the president for the workers
    union for hotels and restaurants. His success was attributed to his strong
    work ethic. As the general manager of the Abella Group, a catering
    company, Mr. Rahi regularly visited business sites. On the day of the
    bombing, Mr. Rahi was on a business trip to the Embassy kitchen. Mr. Rahi
    s vehicle parked outside the Embassy was the only indication of his
    whereabouts after the explosion. As no body was recovered from the
    destroyed building, his family waited days by the phone to receive word in
    the hopes that he would be in a nearby hospital. It wasn t until the
    eighth day after the attack that they received a request to come to the
    morgue to identify Mr. Rahi amongst unidentified body parts collected from
    the blast. All that remained was a single right hand, which they buried
    with his suit at a funeral attended by thousands of friends and family.
    Neither the Lebanese nor the United States authorities ever informed the
    family of any investigation into the bombing. The only compensation the
    family received was a $20,000 insurance policy from the Abella Group. As a
    result, Mr. Rahi s only son, Joseph, who was 22-years-old at the time, was
    forced to leave school and work two jobs to the support his mother and
    sisters. Mr. Rahi s son said in an interview that to this day strangers
    still stop him on the street of Beirut to speak with him about his father.
    They speak of his father s honesty and how well respected he was within
    the community. His son recalled Mr. Rahi s love for cigars, cards, and
    hunting, and how his father s dry sense of humor always made him the life
    of any social gathering. Background Mr. Rahi is in Omid because of the
    overwhelming evidence connecting the Islamic Republic of Iran to the 1983
    bombing at the American embassy in Beirut. This attack, claimed by a group
    called Islamic Jihad, was the first in a series of related bombings
    carried out in Lebanon between 1983 and 1984, which claimed at least 396
    lives. In the early 1980s, Lebanon was a highly volatile country, home to
    conflicting military and political agendas and where the Islamic Republic
    exercised growing influence with the stated aim of spreading the Islamic
    Revolution. Already hostile to American influence in the Middle East and
    further angered by the United States military support of Iraq, Iran s foe
    in the Iran-Iraq war, the Islamic Republic s leaders became exasperated
    when, following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the summer of 1982, the
    United States brokered a Lebanese-Israeli truce and deployed a large
    contingent of American servicemen in the framework of a Multinational
    Peacekeeping Force. Islamic Jihad was a heretofore little-noticed group
    known only for a string of grenade attacks launched on French, Italian,
    and American members of the Multinational Force in March of 1983. When it
    claimed responsibility for the embassy bombing, Islamic Jihad declared
    that the attack was part of the Iranian revolution s campaign against
    imperialist targets throughout the world. The group promised that We shall
    keep striking at any imperialist presence in Lebanon, including the
    Multinational Force. (Two massive bomb attacks against American and French
    servicemen indeed followed on October 23, 1983). Islamic Jihad was a
    shadowy subset of Hezbollah (Party of God), a radical, armed Shi ite
    organization with deep ideological and organizational ties to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. As early as August of 1979, Iran s Supreme Leader,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, had alluded to the establishment of a Party of God
    that would unite Muslims around the goal of resisting American and Israeli
    designs for the Middle East. So far, the oppressed have been disunited and
    nothing happens through disunity. Now that an example of the unity of the
    downtrodden has materialized in the land of Muslims [the Islamic
    Revolution], this example will have to be applied in a wider context, to
    encompass all humanity, through the establishment of a Party of the
    Downtrodden, which is the same as the Party of God [ Hezbollah ], and
    which is in line with the exalt
