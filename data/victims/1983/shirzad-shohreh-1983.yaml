    Information about Ms. Shohreh Shirzad has been provided by a former
    cellmate through an electronic form. Ms. Shirzad is one of the 430
    individuals whose name appears on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the
    website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list contains the names of those members
    of the Organization who died after the Revolution of 1979. More than 400
    of the individuals on this list have been executed. According to her
    cellmate, Ms. Shirzad had dark skin and black hair. She was from Abadan
    and her cellmate called her “Abadani Girl.” Other prisoners from Room 6 of
    Section 240 in Evin prison loved her. She was warm and friendly; she
    always had a smile on her face. She was the only child in her family and
    her mother did everything she could to prevent her execution. Ms. Shirzad
    knew that she would be executed but she would not let that upset her. She
    tried to enjoy her short life among her cellmates. The Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of
    dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The details of Ms. Shirzad’s arrest are not known. She was interrogated at
    Branch 6 of the Prosecution Office in Evin prison, during which she was
    flogged on her head and soles. During the first week of her detention, she
    was kept in the corridor leading to interrogation room, from which one
    could hear other prisoners being tortured. She was denied the right to be
    represented by an attorney and access to her file. Trial There is no
    information regarding this trial. Charges The charges brought against the
    defendant are not known. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense No
    information is available concerning Ms. Shirzad’s defense. Judgment No
    specific information is available about the verdict leading to this
    execution. Ms. Shoreh Shirzad was shot by a firing squad in Evin prison in
    the winter of 1983.
