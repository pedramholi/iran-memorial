    charged with being actively involved in heroin dealing, transporting 1 kg
    and 5 gm of heroin when arrested and confessing to dealing several
    kilograms of heroin at different times. It should also be mentioned that
    he had a long history of heroin dealing. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Hosseinkhani s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office sentenced Mr. Hosseinkhani to death. The sentence was
    carried out.
