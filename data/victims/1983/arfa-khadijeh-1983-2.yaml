    Her independence, which would take her far, was honed in the family nest.
    Later, she was not only the sweetheart among all her friends, but pressed
    them, too, for their answers. Information about Ms. Khadijeh Arfa was
    obtained from an Omid Memorial electronic form filled in by a friend who
    went to college with her, as well as from a book published by Rah-e Kargar
    (Worker s Path) titled Our Martyrs in the Path to Freedom, the Path to
    Socialism . Ms. Arfa was born in 1959 in Nurabad of Mamasani to a
    traditional family. Her father was the village mullah. She worked hard to
    gain her independence in the family. Before the Revolution in 1979, she
    left to study at the Social Science Faculty of Tehran University. One of
    her friends from college recounts: On the first day of school in 1977, Ms.
    Arfa entered the university in her traditional tribal dress and long
    braids. She kept her sweet provincial accent till the end. Ms. Arfa kept
    her independence even when she was part of a group. She had a critical
    edge and kept asking How and Why. After the Revolution, she joined Rah-e
    Kargar and had an active role in advertising for the group and
    distributing its statements and publications. Once the universities were
    closed for Cultural Revolution, she returned to Shiraz and continued her
    activism with Rah-e Kargar from there. It was there that she married Mr.
    Changiz Ahmadi, who was also later executed. Ms. Arfa was the sweetheart
    among all her friends and cellmates because of her simple charm and inner
    beauty. Rah-e Kargar (Worker s Path) or Organization of the Revolutionary
    Workers of Iran announced its existence in July 1979. The organization
    consisted of various leftist groups that opposed guerilla warfare, were in
    favor of political opposition, and proclaimed themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists for socialist revolution and rule of the proletariat.
    They differed from the Tudeh Party (communist party supportive of the
    Soviet Union) in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah
    Khomeini s leadership from the beginning. Arrest and detention Ms. Arfa
    was arrested along with her husband in the spring of 1982. The details of
    her arrest and detention remain unknown. According to her cellmates, she
    was tortured. Trial No information regarding this individual s trial is
    available. Charges The charges brought against Ms. Arfa are not known.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on this individual s defense. Judgment Ms.
    Arfa was executed in Shiraz in 1983. No further details are available.
