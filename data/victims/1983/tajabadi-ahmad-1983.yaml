    The execution of Mr. Ahmad Tajabadi, along with three others, was reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on November 16, 1983. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr.
    Tajabadi was reportedly charged with large-scale drug trafficking,
    transportation, distribution and storage. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Tajabadi's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Hormozgan sentenced Mr. Tajabadi to death. Having been confirmed by the
    Islamic Revolutionary Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out at dawn.
