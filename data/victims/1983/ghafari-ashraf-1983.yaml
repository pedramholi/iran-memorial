    The execution of Ms. Ashraf Ghafari, along with eleven others, was
    announced in a communiqu by the Tribunal of the Anti-Narcotics Section of
    the Public Prosecutor s Office. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on February 15, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to
    this report, Ms. Ghafari was charged with transporting and using heroin,
    having illicit relationships repeatedly and drinking wine. It was also
    reported that she had been sentenced to Hadd (penal punishment) three
    times but continued committing adultery- which is against the Sharia law.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Ms. Ghafari's defense. Judgment The
    Tribunal of the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor s Office
    declared Ms. Ghafari a corruptor on earth and sentenced her to death.
    Having been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out.
