    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Ali Alaee was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on January 4, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Alaee was reported to be
    charged with three counts of first-degree murder. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Alaee's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Bakhtaran sentenced Mr. Alaee to death. The sentence was
    carried out in the prison of Bakhtaran police headquarters.
