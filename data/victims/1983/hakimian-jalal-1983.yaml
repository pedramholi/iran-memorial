    The execution of Mr. Jalal Hakimian was made public on May 13, 1983 by the
    Baha'i Universal House of Justice and published in Baha'i World, volume
    19, 1994. Additional information has been drawn from various issues of the
    World Baha i Volumes. He is also one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in
    a 1999 report published by the Baha i International Community. The report,
    Iran s Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious Community ,
    documents the persecutions of the members of the Faith in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since 1978. Additional
    information has been drawn from various issues of the The Baha i World .
    See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994. Mr. Hakimian was a
    retired writer whose field of interest when he was a student had included
    the study of literature, English and psychology. He was not married. He
    was a profound student of the Baha'i faith. Mr. Hakimian had served as a
    translator in the Ministry of Health. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic
    of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected
    the members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest
    religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to
    systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most
    fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the
    Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it
    as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the
    time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified
    and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of
    Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention There is no information
    about his arrest except that he was arrested and detained in Esfahan
    prison since October 1982. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Hakiman's trial, including whether or not he had legal counsel. Charges
    The charges against Mr. Hakiman are not known. Because of the unanimous
    international condemnation of the persecution of this quietist
    (apolitical) religious community, Iranian authorities do not always admit
    that the Baha'is are being punished for their religious beliefs.
    Therefore, judicial authorities have often wrongfully charged Baha'is with
    offenses such as "being involved in counter-revolutionary activities,"
    "having supported the former regime," "being agents of Zionism," or "being
    involved with prostitution, adultery, and immorality." Evidence of guilt
    No information is available on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hakiman's defense.
    The representatives of the Baha'i community stress that their members are
    being persecuted for their religious beliefs. They refute the validity of
    charges such as counter-revolutionary political activities or spying
    leveled against them in Iranian courts. They point out that the
    fundamental principles of their religion require them to show loyalty and
    obedience to their government and refrain from any political involvement.
    Judgment This defendant was sentenced to death and executed. Baha'is have
    reported to human rights organizations that the text of sentences is often
    not communicated to them. _______________________ 1- Slow Death for Iran s

    grants no rights to Baha'is, and the courts have denied them the right to
    redress or to protection against assault, murder, and other forms of
    persecution and abuse. In so doing, the courts have treated Baha'is as
    unprotected citizens or "apostates," citing eminent religious authorities
    whose edicts are considered to be a source of law equal to acts of
    Parliament. The Founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, made
    execution a punishment for the crime of apostasy a
