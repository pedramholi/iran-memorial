    The execution of Ms. Shamsi Moradi Movahedi, along with sixteen others,

    from prison, and having been convicted previously several times . The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be

    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Moradi Movahedi's defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal in Tehran declared Mr. Moradi Movahedi a
    corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by
    the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out at 5 a.m.
