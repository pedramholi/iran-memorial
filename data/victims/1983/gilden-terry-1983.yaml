    Terry Gilden was one of 63 victims of the bombing of the American Embassy
    in Beirut, Lebanon, which took place on April 18, 1983. At approximately
    1:05 PM, a truck loaded with nearly 2,000 pounds of explosives careened
    through the driveway of the American embassy and crashed into the
    building. A massive explosion ripped through all seven levels of the
    embassy, sending debris flying hundreds of feet into the air and causing
    the burning building to collapse on itself. In addition to those who lost
    their lives, at least 120 people were injured. At the time, it was the
    deadliest attack on an American diplomatic mission since World War II. Mr.
    Gilden was one of 12 American civilian employees of the U.S. Embassy who
    were killed in the explosion. Mr. Gilden was born on September 15, 1957 in
    Chandler, Arizona. As a high school student, he enlisted in the United
    States Army to become a Ranger. His father described his son as army all
    the way. Once in the Army, Mr. Gilden underwent extensive training, which
    included SCUBA-certification, high altitude military parachuting, and
    demonstrations for FBI trainees on freeing hostages from buildings. Mr.
    Gilden became an elite member of the Special Forces Unit. In March 1983,
    he was given his first assignment under a State Department cover as a
    bodyguard to the United States Ambassador. Mr. Terry Gilden was married to
    Mary Gilden, and had one daughter named Teresa, who was 4 months old when
    Mr. Gilden was killed at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon. Mrs.
    Lorraine Gilden, the victim s mother, described Mr. Gilden s excitement
    for his new born baby, [he] was so crazy about [his daughter]. He loved
    kids, babies so yes, he was excited to be a father. Mr. Gilden was also an
    avid outdoorsman and enjoyed activities such as hunting, fishing, camping,
    and hiking. After his memorial service in Brewster, Washington, two of his
    fellow Rangers from the Army scattered his ashes in the Pasayton
    Wilderness where he loved to hike. Background Mr. Gilden is in Omid
    because of the overwhelming evidence connecting the Islamic Republic of
    Iran to the 1983 bombing at the American embassy in Beirut. This attack,
    claimed by a group called Islamic Jihad, was the first in a series of
    related bombings carried out in Lebanon between 1983 and 1984, which
    claimed at least 396 lives. In the early 1980s, Lebanon was a highly
    volatile country, home to conflicting military and political agendas and
    where the Islamic Republic exercised growing influence with the stated aim
    of spreading the Islamic Revolution. Already hostile to American influence
    in the Middle East and further angered by the United States military
    support of Iraq, Iran s foe in the Iran-Iraq war, the Islamic Republic s
    leaders became exasperated when, following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon
    in the summer of 1982, the United States brokered a Lebanese-Israeli truce
    and deployed a large contingent of American servicemen in the framework of
    a Multinational Peacekeeping Force. Islamic Jihad was a heretofore
    little-noticed group known only for a string of grenade attacks launched
    on French, Italian, and American members of the Multinational Force in
    March of 1983. When it claimed responsibility for the embassy bombing,
    Islamic Jihad declared that the attack was part of the Iranian revolution
    s campaign against imperialist targets throughout the world. The group
    promised that We shall keep striking at any imperialist presence in
    Lebanon, including the Multinational Force. (Two massive bomb attacks
    against American and French servicemen indeed followed on October 23,
    1983). Islamic Jihad was a shadowy subset of Hezbollah (Party of God), a
    radical, armed Shi ite organization with deep ideological and
    organizational ties to the Islamic Republic of Iran. As early as August of
    1979, Iran s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, had alluded to the
    establishment of a Party of God that would unite Muslims around the goal
    of resisting American and Israeli designs for the Middle East. So far, the
    oppressed have been disunited and nothing happens through disunity. Now
    that an example of the unity of the downtrodden has materialized in the
    land of Muslims [the Islamic Revolution], this example will have to be
    applied in a wider context, to encompass all humanity, through the
    establishment of a Party of the Downtrodden, which is the same as the
    Party of God [ Hezbollah ], and which is in line with the exalted will of
    God Past mistakes must be rectified through Muslim unity and the
    establishment of the Party of the Downtrodden against the great powers,
    led by the criminal America and its very corrupt stooge, Israel. *
    Punishing those who supported Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war was another
    publicly discussed subject. The Islamic Republic s leaders were blunt
    about the potential consequences of the United States support for Iraq. As
    Khomeini stated in a speech of July 25, 1982, If we see that governments
    are giving financial and military assistance to the Iraqi govern
