    Mr. Frank J Johnston was one of 63 victims of the bombing of the American
    Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, which took place on April 18, 1983. At
    approximately 1:05 PM, a truck loaded with nearly 2,000 pounds of
    explosives careened through the driveway of the American embassy and
    crashed into the building. A massive explosion ripped through all seven
    levels of the embassy, sending debris flying hundreds of feet into the air
    and causing the burning building to collapse on itself. In addition to
    those who lost their lives, at least 120 people were injured. At the time,
    it was the deadliest attack on an American diplomatic mission since World
    War II. Mr. Johnston was one of 12 American civilian employees of the U.S.
    Embassy who were killed in the explosion. Background Mr. Johnston is in
    Omid because of the overwhelming evidence connecting the Islamic Republic
    of Iran to the 1983 bombing at the American embassy in Beirut. This
    attack, claimed by a group called Islamic Jihad, was the first in a series
    of related bombings carried out in Lebanon between 1983 and 1984, which
    claimed at least 396 lives. In the early 1980s, Lebanon was a highly
    volatile country, home to conflicting military and political agendas and
    where the Islamic Republic exercised growing influence with the stated aim
    of spreading the Islamic Revolution. Already hostile to American influence
    in the Middle East and further angered by the United States military
    support of Iraq, Iran s foe in the Iran-Iraq war, the Islamic Republic s
    leaders became exasperated when, following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon
    in the summer of 1982, the United States brokered a Lebanese-Israeli truce
    and deployed a large contingent of American servicemen in the framework of
    a Multinational Peacekeeping Force. Islamic Jihad was a heretofore
    little-noticed group known only for a string of grenade attacks launched
    on French, Italian, and American members of the Multinational Force in
    March of 1983. When it claimed responsibility for the embassy bombing,
    Islamic Jihad declared that the attack was part of the Iranian revolution
    s campaign against imperialist targets throughout the world. The group
    promised that We shall keep striking at any imperialist presence in
    Lebanon, including the Multinational Force. (Two massive bomb attacks
    against American and French servicemen indeed followed on October 23,
    1983). Islamic Jihad was a shadowy subset of Hezbollah (Party of God), a
    radical, armed Shi ite organization with deep ideological and
    organizational ties to the Islamic Republic of Iran. As early as August of
    1979, Iran s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, had alluded to the
    establishment of a Party of God that would unite Muslims around the goal
    of resisting American and Israeli designs for the Middle East. So far, the
    oppressed have been disunited and nothing happens through disunity. Now
    that an example of the unity of the downtrodden has materialized in the
    land of Muslims [the Islamic Revolution], this example will have to be
    applied in a wider context, to encompass all humanity, through the
    establishment of a Party of the Downtrodden, which is the same as the
    Party of God [ Hezbollah ], and which is in line with the exalted will of
    God Past mistakes must be rectified through Muslim unity and the
    establishment of the Party of the Downtrodden against the great powers,
    led by the criminal America and its very corrupt stooge, Israel. *
    Punishing those who supported Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war was another
    publicly discussed subject. The Islamic Republic s leaders were blunt
    about the potential consequences of the United States support for Iraq. As
    Khomeini stated in a speech of July 25, 1982, If we see that governments
    are giving financial and military assistance to the Iraqi government, we
    consider them guilty we will deal with them as we do with guilty people,
    and we will enforce the Islamic sentences concerning them. Ayatollah
    Khomeini repeatedly demonized the United States and expressed concern
    about its influence in the Muslim world. He emphasized that Muslims had a
    duty to rise up against autocratic leaders and that Iran would help them
    drive America out. In his speeches, he routinely called on Muslims, both
    Sunni and Shia, to follow the Iranian line on matters of foreign policy.
    Muslims problems are all caused by great powers and their insinuations and
    suggestions to their stooges in the region, he said in January of 1983.
    All problems are caused by them, and these problems will not be resolved
    unless we rid ourselves of them. Khomeini was particularly harsh when it
    came to Egypt and Lebanon: Is it not shameful for Muslims that a country
    which is considered the enemy of Islam and the enemy of humanity, reaches
    out from the other side of the world to determine the fate of Muslim
    countries? ... America pursues its corrupt goals through [Islamic and
    Arab] governments dependent on it, through wicked writers and speakers,
    and Muslims are just sitting [and doing nothing]. Is it
