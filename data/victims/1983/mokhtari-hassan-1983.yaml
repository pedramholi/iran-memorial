    Mr. Hassan Mokhtari (Tufan) is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Marxist-Leninist Organization of Tufan was
    founded in the late 1960s. De-Stalinization policy of Khoroshev in the
    Soviet Union led to a political crisis in Iranian communist party Tudeh,
    as in many communist parties around the world. Three Tudeh leaders i.e.
    Forutan, Qasemi Saqa i left the Party in 1963 to found the Revolutionary
    Organization of the Tudeh Party and then the Marxist-Leninist Organization
    of Tufan . The organization changed its name after the 1979 revolution and
    first became The Party of workers and farmers of Iran and later on Iran
    Work Party, Tufan. The Party believed in a one-party system and supported
    a political system modeled after Albania, which it considered as the only
    socialist countries. The Organization of Struggling Workers of Iran is a
    split from Tufan founded by some of the party s personnel. Arrest and
