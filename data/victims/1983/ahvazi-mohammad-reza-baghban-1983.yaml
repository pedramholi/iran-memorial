    Information about Mr. Mohammad Reza Baghban Ahvazi, known as Amir, has
    been drawn from an electronic form sent to Omid by an individual familiar
    with this case. He is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. According to the form, he was a member of the
    Ettehadieh Komonist-ha. The form states that he was born into a poor and
    underprivileged family in Ahvaz. As a high school student, he became
    interested in politics and lived an underground life for some time. He,
    then, immigrated to the United States and started to study medicine. But
    after three years, he changed his mind and continued his education in
    electrical engineering in Oklahoma State University… When he was a student
    in the US, he joined the Ettehadieh Komonist-ha. He returned to Iran
    during the Revolution and he probably was a key member of the Ettehadieh
    branch in the south. The “Ettehadieh Komonist-ha” was created by exiled
    opponents of the Pahlavi regime who mostly belonged to the Student
    Confederation. They followed the teachings of Mao Tse-Tung and did not
    believe in guerilla warfare. The group became marked by ideological
    divides during the periods preceding and following the 1979 revolution
    which caused it to split into several factions. One of the most important
    rifts was triggered by the decision by a number of members to take up arms
    and take over a city in Iran. The uprising plan, devised in the midst of
    an active and violent anti-communist campaign by the revolutionary Islamic
    government, split the Ettehadieh in two factions: one believing in the
    armed movement and the other opposing it. In the winter of 1982, armed
    members of the Ettehadieh hid in a forest in the North of Iran (Jangal in
    Farsi) outside the city of Amol (Mazandaran province). This group, also
    known as the Jangal group, was involved in several clashes with the
    Revolutionary guards and ultimately, on January 26, attacked the city of
    Amol hoping to generate a general uprising. The attempt to seize Amol
    failed. It is reported that a number of the group’s members, revolutionary
    guards, and civilians were killed during the Amol clash. Subsequently,
    members of the Ettehadieh, including those who opposed the Amol uprising,
    were arrested and tried for belonging to the organization and for having
    participated in the Amol clash. Arrest and detention The details of Mr.
    Baghban Ahvazi’s arrest and detention are unknown. According to the form,
    he was arrested in Ahvaz in April/May 1982. Trial No information is
    available about the trial. Charges The charges brought against the
    defendant are not knwon. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense. Judgment
    Mr. Mohammad Reza Baghban Ahvazi was condemned to death. According to
    Mojahed , he was executed by a firing squad on April 21, 1983 in Ahvaz.
    The sender of the electronic form states that he was executed on May 7.
