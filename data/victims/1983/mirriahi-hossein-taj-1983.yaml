    The execution of Mr. Hossein Tajmirriahi, a member of the Ettehadieh
    Komonista-ha, along with 21 others, was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on January 27, 1983. The report quotes the public relations of the
    Islamic Revolution’s Public Prosecutor’s Office in Tehran. The information
    about his charges and defenses were published in the same newspaper on
    January 10, 1983. This execution was also reported in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in
    1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. The Ettehadieh Komonist-ha (the Union of Communists of Iran)
    was created by exiled opponents of the Pahlavi regime who mostly belonged
    to the Student Confederation. They followed the teachings of Mao Tse-Tung
    and did not believe in guerilla warfare. The group became marked by
    ideological divides during the periods preceding and following the 1979
    revolution which caused it to split into several factions. One of the most
    important rifts was triggered by the decision by a number of members to
    take up arms and take over a city in Iran. The uprising plan, devised in
    the midst of an active and violent anti-communist campaign by the
    revolutionary Islamic government, split the Union in two factions: one
    supporting the armed movement and the other opposing it. In the winter of
    1982, armed members of the Union hid in a forest in the North of Iran
    (Jangal in Farsi) outside the city of Amol. This group, also known as the
    Sarbedaran-e Jangal , was involved in several clashes with the
    Revolutionary guards and ultimately, on January 26, attacked the city of
    Amol hoping to generate a general uprising. The attempt to seize Amol
    failed. It is reported that a number of the group’s members, revolutionary
    guards, and civilians were killed during the Amol clash. Subsequently,
    members of the Union, including those who opposed the Amol uprising, were
    arrested and tried for belonging to the organization and for having
    participated in the Amol clash. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial According to
    this report Mr. Tajmirriahi was tried along with 28 to 29 others between
    January 9th and 15th, 1983. The trial took place at the 1st division of
    the Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecutor’s Office in Tehran with
    Ayatollah Mohammadi Gilani as the residing judge. Charges Mr.
    Tajmirriahi’s indictment was read to him by Asadollah Lajevardi, Tehran’s
    Public Prosecutor. The text of this indictment is as follows: “being a
    member of the Central Committee at the Union of the Communists of Iran
    (known as Sarbedaran-e Jangal), being the leader of this organization when
    arrested, being the director and one of the masterminds behind the attack
    at Amol on January 26, 1982, directly participating in this attack which
    led to the martyrdom of tens of the Hezbollah Ummah and wounding of 40
    others, gathering and dispatching forces to the forest with the intention
    of carrying out an armed attack against the Islamic Republic of Iran,
    delivering weapons and munitions to the head of the military branch in the
    forest..., possessing several G3 rifles, Klashinkovs, Uzis, Colts,
    grenades and munitions as well as a complete wireless network in his safe
    house”. Evidence of guilt According to this report, only “parts of Mr.
    Tajmirriahi’s defense” was published. The main part of his defense
    includes confessions to his alleged crimes, such as “being a member of the
    Central Committee in the Union of the Communists of Iran, being one of the
    masterminds behind the attack at Amol, armed participation in the attack,
    gathering and dispatching forces to the forest and delivering weapons and
    munitions to the military manager in the forest.” Moreover, he was quoted
    claiming: “that the people should make revolutions, we took refuge in
    forest with 70 weapons and 100 forces. We were surrounded by the
    Revolutionary Guards and had clashes with them several times during our
    five-month stay there…As our stay was prolonged in the forest, we ran out
    of provisions and had to buy food from the villagers. By mid-January we
    decided to attack the city in order to siege the military centers in Amol
    such as the Revolutionary Guards Corps and Basij (mobilization) forces. We
    started our revolt from Amol, thinking that people would join us. The
    clash started at 11 pm and people joined the Police force (Niruye
    Entezami), so we had to escape to the forest again in the morning.” It was
    also reported that the defendant had confessed to “the supply of weapons
    from abroad, garrisons, Kurdestan and the war fronts in southern Iran.”
    Defense The report of this execution does not contain actual information
    regarding the defendant’s defense, what is labeled as defense is his
    actual confession. Judgment The 1st division of the
