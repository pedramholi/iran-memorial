    The execution of Mr. Saleh Sayadi Modafe, along with sixteen others, was
    announced in a communiqu from the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami Daily on October 8, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Sayadi Modafe was
    reportedly charged with being actively involved in the purchase and
    distribution of narcotics, establishing an international drug trafficking
    gang, and having been convicted previously several times. He was also
    charged with possessing 32 kg of morphine, 2042 kg of opium and a 360
    liter of acid anhydric as well as being in possession of equipment and
    materials for selling heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Sayadi
    Modafe's defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal in Tehran declared Mr. Sayadi Modafe a corruptor on earth and
    sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the
    sentence was carried out at 5 a.m.
