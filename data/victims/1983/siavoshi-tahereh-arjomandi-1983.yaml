    Ms. Arjomandi was an active, forgiving, selfless, and respectable woman.
    She had worked as a nurse in suburban Tehran, Yasuj, and Shiraz, and had
    been selected as an exemplary nurse. News of the execution of Ms. Tahereh
    Arjomandi (Siavoshi) (also spelled "Tahirih Arjumandi (Siyavushi)"),
    daughter of Massihollah, and 9 other Baha i women was published in the
    Times newspaper (June 21, 1983). She was one of the 206 individuals whose
    name was published in the Worldwide Baha i Community s 1999 report. This
    report, entitled The Baha i Question: Iran s Secret Blueprint for the
    Destruction of a Religious Community , dealt with the persecution of
    members of the Baha i faith in Iran by the Islamic Republic, and contained
    a list of Baha is who were killed in Iran since 1979. Additional
    information was obtained from Khabar-e Jonoob newspaper (February 12, and
    February 22, 1983); The New York Times (May 22, 1983); Sahifeye Imam (The
    Imam s Book ), Volume 17 (May 28, 1983); Baha i World Almanac, Volume 18,
    1979-1983 (Haifa, 1986); an account of events as published in A Tribute to
    the Faithful by Mah Mehr Golestaneh (1992); the book Olya s Story written
    by Olya Ruhizadegan; Andalib Magazine (Winter 1988), the Archives of Baha
    i Persecution in Iran (undated); Morteza Esmailipur s YouTube Channel
    (April 27, and June 15, 2016); Martyrs of the Baha i Religion website
    (undated); Dar Gozar-e Tarikh ( Throughout History ) Telegram Channel
    (June18, 2019); and the Report of the United States Congressional Hearing
    published in the World Order Magazine (Winter 1983-1984). Ms. Arjomandi
    was born in 1951-52 in Tehran, and resided in the city of Shiraz. She was
    married and deeply loved her husband. As a young girl and later on as a
    young woman, Ms. Arjomandi was an active participant in morality and
    ethics courses and a member of the Youth Organization. Ms. Arjomandi was a
    graduate of Tehran University s Nursing School and was an Assistant to the
    Baha is Deputies Council and a member of the Publication of Teachings and
    Culture Lajneh* ( committee ) in Shiraz. Those who knew Ms. Arjomandi well
    said that she was a forgiving and selfless person and that they had great
    respect for her. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran, undated; Morteza
    Esmailipur s YouTube Channel, April 27; Andalib Magazine; Morteza
    Esmailipur s YouTube Channel, June 15, 2016). Ms. Arjomandi passed the
    Study Abroad Examination and everything was set for her to continue her
    education in the United States, but she decided to stay in Iran and
    continue her studies at Tehran University. (Iran Wire). In 1976-77, Ms.
    Arjomandi and her husband, Mr. Jamshid Siavoshi , settled in the city of
    Yassuj n order to establish a Baha i spiritual assembly there. She worked
    at a hospital in Yassuj and was selected as an exemplary nurse. Ms.
    Arjomandi and her husband were forced to leave Yassuj in December 1978,
    and take up residence in Shiraz, after a group of individuals, instigated
    by a cleric, attacked and pillaged their home and property. They spent a
    period of time in poverty. She looked for employment at several hospitals
    in Shiraz but they did not hire her because she was a Baha i. After being
    out of work for a while, Ms. Arjomandi finally found employment as a nurse
    at a private hospital. She and her husband supported Baha is whose
    property had been expropriated. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran,
    undated; Andalib Magazine; Iran Wire). Ms. Arjomandi s case is related to
    the death sentence issued for 22 Baha is and the execution of 6 Baha i men
    and 10 Baha i women in June 1983 in Shiraz. Extensive international
    efforts were made in order to save the imprisoned Baha is. About a month
    prior to the implementation of the death sentences, then-U.S. President
    Ronald Reagan asked the Islamic Republic of Iran s authorities to stop the
    executions. A week after the American President s message, Ayatollah
    Khomeini, then-Leader of the Islamic Republic, addressing the U.S.
    government at a gathering of Iranian officials and stated: We wouldn t
    have heard a peep out of you if these people were not spies. [You re
    speaking up now] because these are a bunch of people who are on your side
    and [protect] your interests And now [you] are making all this noise for
    22 Baha is, who, they claim, have gotten entangled and been entrapped in
    Iran, and now all of a sudden [you] are humanitarians and are crying foul
    and pleading with the whole world to come to these people s rescue. [But]
    people know you [better] (The New York Times, May 22, 1983; Sahifeye Imam,
    Volume 17, May 28, 1983). The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran:
    Background The Baha i religious community is the largest minority group in
    Iran, with approximately 300,000 members in 1979 (more current figures are
    not available).** The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected
    Baha is religious to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them
    of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha i religion is not
    recognized u
