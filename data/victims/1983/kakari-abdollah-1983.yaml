    The execution of Mr. Abdollah Kakary, along with nine others, was
    announced in a communiqu from the Islamic Revolution s Public Prosecutor s
    Office in Sistan and Baluchestan. This communiqu was reported in the
    Jomhuri Eslami Daily on November 3, 1983. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this communiqu , Mr. Kakary was charged with being
    consistently involved in the purchase and distribution of narcotics as
    well as possession of 4 kg of heroin. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Kakary's
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolution s Public Prosecutor s Office in
    Sistan and Baluchestan sentenced Mr. Kakery to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out.
