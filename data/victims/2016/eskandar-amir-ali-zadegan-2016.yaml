    News of the execution of Mr. Amir Ali Zadegan Eskandar, along with four
    other individuals, was announced by the website of Human Rights Defenders
    Association of Kurdistan (January 6, 2006). Mr. Zadegan Eskandar was
    married. His case and those of two others pertain to crimes connected to
    narcotics. Arrest and detention Mr. Zadegan Eskandar spent time in Ward 7
    of Tabriz Central Prison. However, there is no information available on
    the details of his arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Zadegan Eskandar went
    on trial in East Azarbaijan Province. However, there is no information
    available on the details of the session or sessions of his trial. Charges
    Mr. Zadegan Eskandar was charged with crimes connected to narcotics. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information
    available on the details of the evidence of guilt entered against Mr.
    Zadegan Eskandar. Defense There is no information available on the details
    of Mr. Zadegan Eskandar s defense. Judgment Mr. Amir Ali Zadegan Eskandar
    was sentenced to death. He was hanged, along with his uncle, wife, and
    another individual, in the courtyard of Tabriz Central Prison on
    Wednesday, January 6, 2006.
