    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Reza Akbari along with five other

    Agency (HRANA), Iran Human Rights and Kurdistan Human Rights Association
    (KMMK) on January 13, 2016. His case pertains to murder. The provincial

    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in

    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information available on
    the details of the evidence of guilt entered against Mr. Akbari. Defense
    There is no information available on the details of Mr. Akbari s defense.
