    The news and information regarding the execution of Mr. Esma'il Ayubi
    Jarami was sent to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center via two electronic forms
    by his acquaintances on December 21, 2017 and May 23, 2018. (ABC e-forms)
    In addition, news of the execution of Mr. Ayubi Jarami, along with seven*
    other individuals, was announced by the websites of Human Rights Activists
    News Agency HRANA and Iran Human Rights on September 29, 2016. Additional
    information on this case was obtained by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center
    through independent research. Mr. Ayubi Jarami was born in Orumieh in
    1975. He was married and had five children. Mr. Ayubi Jarami used to live
    and work in Orumieh. He was self-employed, and was a gregarious and
    patient man (electronic form, December 21, 2017). The case of Mr. Ayubi
    Jarami pertains to illegal drugs. Arrest and detention Mr. Ayubi Jarami
    was arrested in the city of Orumieh on the afternoon of November 8, 2011
    (electronic forms, December 21, 2017; May 23, 2018). Mr. Ayubi Jarami
    served some of his prison term in Orumieh Central Prison (Darya) (HRANA
    and Iran Human Rights, September 29, 2016). However, there is no
    information available on the details of his arrest and detention. Trial
    There is no information available on the details of the session or
    sessions of Mr. Ayubi Jarami s trial. Charges Mr. Ayubi Jarami was charged
    with purchase and sale of illegal drugs (HRANA and Iran Human Rights,
    September 29, 2016). The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    There is no information available on the details of the evidence of guilt
    entered against Mr. Ayubi Jarami. Defense There is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Ayubi Jarami s defense. Judgment Mr.
    Esma'il Ayubi Jarami was hanged, along with seven other individuals, in
    Orumieh Central Prison (Darya) on the morning of September 29, 2016 (HRANA
    and Iran Human Rights, September 29, 2016). Mr. Ayubi Jarami s funeral
    services were held at the Mohammad Rasoulallah Mosque of the Band Village
    in West Azarbaijan (Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s independent research).
    There is no further information available on the details of this
    execution. ---------------------- * Ms. Moluk Nuri , Messrs. Behnam
