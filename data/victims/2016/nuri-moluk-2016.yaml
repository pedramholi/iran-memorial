    News of the execution of Ms. Moluk Nuri along with seven* other
    individuals was announced by the websites of Human Rights Activists News
    Agency (HRANA) and Center of Democracy and Human Rights in Kurdistan
    (Mafnews) on September 29, 2016. Additional information on this case was
    obtained from the website of the Organization of Kurdistan s Women
    (November 2, 2016) and Kurdistan Human Rights (KHRN) (October 1, 2016).
    Ms. Nuri, 55, was a Kurd from Kermanshah (Mafnews, September 29, 2016;
    KHRN, October 1, 2016). Her case pertains to crimes connected to
    narcotics. Arrest and detention Ms. Nuri was arrested by the drug
    enforcement agency of the police force in Orumieh in 2011. Since then she
    was held in Orumieh Central Prison (Darya), where she was unable to meet
    her family members due to great distance and financial difficulties. The
    prison authorities contacted her family on September 28, 2016 so that they
    go and meet Ms. Nuri for the last time. Some of Ms. Nuri s fellow inmates
    helped with collecting the money to fund her family s trip to prison and
    back home (KHRN, October 1, 2016). Trial Ms. Nuri could not afford to hire
    a defense lawyer (KHRN, October 1, 2016). There is no information
    available on the details of the session or sessions of her trial. Charges
    Ms. Nuri was charged with purchase and sale of narcotics (Organization of
    Kurdistan s Women, November 2, 2016). The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    There is no information available on the details of the evidence of guilt
    entered against Ms. Nuri. Defense Due to financial difficulties, Ms. Nuri
    accepted to carry a package for 500 thousand toomans in 2011. The package,
    which contained narcotics, was carried to Orumieh by her (KHRN, October 1,
    2016). However, there is no information available on the details of Ms.
    Nuri s defense. Judgment The Revolutionary Court of Orumieh sentenced Ms.
    Moluk Nuri to death (KHRN, October 1, 2016). She was hanged along with
    seven other individuals in Orumieh Central Prison (Darya) on the morning
    of September 29, 2016 (HRANA and Mafnews, September 29, 2016). When Ms.
    Nuri s family arrived at the prison to meet her for the last time she had
    already been executed (KHRN, October 1, 2016). There is no further
    information available on the details of this execution.
