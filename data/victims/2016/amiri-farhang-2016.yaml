    He was born into a Bah converted family. His father's family was Muslim,
    and his mother's family was Zoroastrian, but both families converted to
    the Bah religion. Information about the life and extrajudicial killing of
    Mr. Farhang Amiri, son of Hedayatollah, has been obtained from the
    websites of Iran Students News Agency or ISNA (September 27, 2016), Iran
    Wire (September 19, 2016), Bah World Community (October 25, 2016), Human
    Rights Activists News Agency or HRANA (November 1, 2016, May 4, June 13,
    and July 26, 2017), Archive of Bah Persecution in Iran (October 28, 2016),
    Center for Human Rights in Iran (October 31, 2016), Bah News (July 5,
    2017) and Melliun Iran (July 26, 2017). According to available
    information, Mr. Amiri was born into a Bah family. His father's family was
    Muslim, and his mother's family was Zoroastrian, but both families
    converted to the Bah religion. Mr. Amiri was born in Hormozak village,
    Yazd, and was 63 years old. He was married and had four children. In 1955,
    during the reign of Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, in the village of Hormozak in
    Yazd, following the incitement of an ayatollah against Bah s, several
    Muslims attacked the residents of this village, the majority of whom were
    Bah , killing a woman and six men, all relatives of Mr. Amiri, including
    his father and uncle. Following his father s death, he and his younger
    brother lived through difficult times. At a young age, they entered the
    labor market and, with hard work, opened an eyeglass shop, which after a
    while turned into two branches. After the revolution, their shops were
    shuttered. Their efforts to reclaim the shops failed. After some time,
    they entered the transportation business and bought a few pieces of land
    and houses. After their property was confiscated for the second time, Mr.
    Amiri started a small farm around the Hormazak village in Yazd and lived
    with his family in the old Qassemabad neighborhood of Yazd. Mr. Amiri
    retired in 2015. "In reality, from the beginning of the revolution, when
    they confiscated his and his father's property, he had no choice but to
    work freelance jobs to earn a living" (Center for Human Rights in Iran). A
    senior representative of the Bah community commenting on Mr. Amiri says:
    "He worked as a driver and also as a farmer; he lived a humble and
    honorable life. He was known among his neighbors for his kindness,
    gentleness, wisdom, and humility. He did not fight with anyone. His family
    environment was characterized by love and kindness, and he encouraged his
    four children to be honest and trustworthy (HRANA, May 4, 2017). According
    to an informed source, Mr. Amiri never promoted or proselytized the Bah
    religion. But he and his family were very well known in the Qassemabad
    neighborhood, and everyone knew them as Bah ' s (Center for Human Rights
    in Iran). The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha
    is in Iran is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was
    in this era that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the
    Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes
    and businesses and in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve
    of his return from France to Iran, in response to a question regarding
    political and religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic
    government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they
    are harmful and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer
    asked another question: Will they be free to perform their religious
    rites? The Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini had previously spoken of the
    Baha i threat to the Shah s regime, Islam, national unity, and national
    security in various speeches. (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Background
    of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic
    Republic of Iran has a long history of politically motivated violence in
    Iran and around the world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic
    operatives inside and outside the country have engaged in kidnapping,
    disappearing, and killing a large number of individuals whose activities
    they deemed undesirable. The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial
    killings inside Iran is not clear; however, these murders began in
    February 1979 and have continued s
