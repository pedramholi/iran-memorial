    Mr. Abbasnia's friends used to call him Arsalan because of his courage and
    boldness. Information regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Abubakr
    Abbasnia, also known as Arsalan, son of Mohammad and Khadijeh, was
    obtained from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center
    with one of his friends (March 7, 2021). News of this killing was also
    published on the official website of the Kurdistan Democratic Party,
    Kurdistan u Kurd (December 22, 2016), and on the Raja News website
    (December 21, 2016). Additional information about this case was obtained
    through interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with Mr.
    Kamal Karimi, member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party s political office
    February 5, 2021; December 22, 2021), with a person with knowledge of the
    case (February 19, 2021), the Kurdistan Democratic Party s By-Laws
    ratified during the Party s 16 th Congress (January - February 2016), and
    other sources.* Mr. Abbasnia was an ethnic Kurd, single, and born on March
    20, 1979, in Mahabad [County s] village of Uzuntash located in West
    Azarabaijan Province. He finished fifth grade in his village and
    subsequently migrated to the city of Mahabad with his family. He quit
    school in middle school for financial reasons and started to work as a
    street vendor and a construction worker. (Boroumand Center interview,
    March 7, 2021). On March 23, 2004, Mr. Abbasnia joined the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan. After the split in the Democratic Party of
    Iranian Kurdistan in 2006, he joined the Kurdistan Democratic Party and
    was active in a number of the Party s sections until December 20, 2016,
    including as a cameraman at the Kurd Television Network, the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party s official TV station, and in the Party s various
    security and protection divisions. He was the person in charge of security
    and protection for the Night of Yalda celebrations of 2016. (Boroumand
    Center interview, March 7, 2021). According to a person close to him, Mr.
    Abbasnia was a kind, happy, sociable, and popular individual and had a
    nice singing voice. Some of his friends used to call him Arsalan because
    of his courage and boldness. He later changed his name to Arsalan.
    (Boroumand Center interview, March 7, 2021). The Kurdish Problem in the
    Islamic Republic After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the disagreements
    between the government of the Shiite Islamic Republic and the
    organizations in the Kurdish regions of western Iran regarding the rights
    and roles of minorities in drafting the Constitution; whether the
    government should be secular or religious, and especially the issue of
    Kurdish autonomy; and conflicts that resulted in Kurdish political
    organizations boycotting the April 1979 Referendum on instituting an
    Islamic Republic; led to serious, and at times armed, clashes between the
    central government and the Peshmerga (Kurdistan Democratic Party s armed
    forces). On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini labeled the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), the oldest and most influential Kurdish
    Party, the Party of the Devil , and declared it unofficial and illegal and
    ordered a military attack on Kurdistan. Mass executions and intense armed
    clashes continued in the region for months, clashes that resulted in the
    deaths of a number of civilians and the displacement and relocation of the
    residents of certain towns. In the next four years, Kurdish parties lost
    their grip on power in the region to a great extent, and relocated to
    Iraqi Kurdistan. Since then, a number of their leaders and members have
    been assassinated outside Iran, especially in Iraqi Kurdistan. In the
    years since the Islamic Republic has been in existence, in addition to
    such entities as the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, Komala
    (Revolutionary Organization of the Toilers of Iranian Kurdistan), the
    Koran School led by Ahmad Moftizadeh, Organization of Iranian Kurdistan
    Struggle (which was active in the early years of the Revolution), certain
    other Kurdish opposition parties were established outside Iran, such as
    the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK) and the Kurdistan Freedom Party
    (PAK). These parties, with policies and ideologies that are not
    necessarily similar and uniform, have settled in parts of the Kurdistan
    Autonomous Region in Iraq, such as Koy, Soleimanieh, and in the foothills
    of Qandil mountains. Some of these parties have undergone splits in recent
    years. These conflicts have been more about the methods of running the
    organizations rather than theoretical and ideological differences. These
    parties have not controlled any part of the Iranian territory since the
    late 1980 s, and have adopted different strategies in different periods in
    order to confront the Islamic Republic, advance their political
    objectives, and recruit members. Beginning in 2006, the conflicts between
    the regime and Kurdish parties who had increased their presence in Iran in
    reaction to the government intensifying the detention and execution of
    Kurdish activis
