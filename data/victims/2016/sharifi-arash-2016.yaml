    Mr. Sharifi and his brother were executed on the same day News of Mr.
    Arash Sharifi and 24 other individuals execution was published by various
    sources including IRNA (August 3, 2016), IRIB News Agency (August 3,
    2016), Fars News Agency (August 2, 2016), Khorassan Newspaper (August 4,
    2016), HRANA (August 3, 2016), Kurdistan Human Rights Defenders Center
    (August 3, 2016), and the Amnesty International Report (November 17,
    2016). Additional information about this execution was obtained through
    the Boroumand Foundation s interview with a person close to Mr. Sharifi
    and with his attorney, from an Information Ministry Announcement (Islamic
    Republic of Iran Information Ministry website, August 3, 2016), Kurdistan
    Province Judiciary Announcement (Fars New Agency, August 2, 2016), and
    from other sources.* Mr. Arash Sharifi, child of Towfiq, was a Sunni Kurd
    from the [city of] Sanandaj. He was married and resided in Sanandaj s
    Shahrak Molavi neighborhood. He had a high school diploma with a
    concentration in the humanities, and owned a men s clothing boutique in
    Sanandaj. According to an acquaintance, Mr. Sharifi was a religious man, a
    follower of the Shafe i** branch of Islam, but was not affiliated with any
    particular group or organization. He had not participated in any religious
    and faith-based classes prior to his arrest, but began studying and
    learning religious subject matters of the Sunni faith in prison, and
    learned two parts of the Koran by heart. He was a quiet and soft-spoken
    person. (Boroumand Foundation interview). Sunni defendants families
    correspondence, including Mr. Sharifi s, with the Leader, the Head of the
    Judiciary, and the President, as well as sit-ins and follow-ups with the
    authorities in protesting the arrest and issuance of a death sentence,
    bore no fruit. According to the Amnesty International report, security
    forces threatened Mr. Sharifi s family and lawyers in order to prevent
    them from releasing information about the cases and to stop them from
    giving interviews to media and human rights organizations. Background
    Based on available information, in the years 2007 to 2009-10, Shi a
    evangelists hurled numerous insults at Sunni beliefs and Sunni respected
    figures, with severe backlash from Sunni religious figures and activists.
    Following famous Shi a movie director Ebrahim Hatamikia s offensive
    statements about Aisha, the Prophet s wife, in Khanevadeye Sabz ( Green
    Family ) Magazine (Volume 195, 2007-08), and statements made by several
    well-known preachers such as Hojjatoleslams Daneshmand, Juybari, and
    Ansari whose speeches were covered by [IRIB,] state radio and television
    in certain instances a number of religious Sunni youth from Kurdistan (who
    considered these insults as being organized) proceeded to hold classes,
    distribute books and CD s in local mosques, universities, and their
    neighborhoods, protesting against these actions and raising awareness, as
    well as promoting and defending the tenets of the Shafe i religion.**
    These CD s contained documented instances of offensive language used
    against Sunni beliefs, quoted from well-known religious sources of the Shi
    a religion such as Bohar-ol-Anvar. The religious activities of these young
    people raised the security apparatus sensitivity. Subsequent to Ayatollah
    Khamenei s trip to Sanandaj in April-May 2009, several young Sunni Kurd
    religious activists were arrested in the name of fighting Salafi and
    Takfiri (term used to denote Sunni extremists such as al-Qaeda and ISIS)
    movements. Three months later, a number of assassinations were carried out
    in Sanandaj, including Mamusta Sheikh-ol-Eslam, member of the Assembly of
    Experts, and Molla Borhan Aali, a Sunni cleric. Security forces accused
    certain individuals of murder, who had been arrested after these
    assassinations. The arrestees denied any connection to armed, extremist,
    or radical groups, objected to the charges brought against them, and asked
    for a new and public trial, to no avail. Ultimately, six of the arrestees
    were executed in December 2012-January 2013, and six others on March 4,
    2015. Also, continuing this process, 25 others, named the Unity and Jihad
    Group , were put to death on August 2, 2016. The issuance and
    implementation of the death penalty for this group of Sunni adherents, was
    followed by the reaction of numerous domestic and international
    individuals and organizations. On June 12, 2014, eighteen human rights
    organizations, including the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation and a human
    rights lawyer, protested the sentences in a declaration and demanded that
    they be rescinded. Furthermore, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch,
    Human Rights Defenders, and the Abdorrahman Borumand Foundation (December
    31, 2014) issued several declarations and calls to action, demanding the
    rescission of the death sentences issued for the defendants of the case,
    and asking for a just, transparent, and public trial. Well-known Sunni
    figures such as Molavi Abdolhamid, Zahedan s Sunni Fr
