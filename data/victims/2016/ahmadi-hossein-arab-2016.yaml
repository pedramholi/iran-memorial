    The execution of Mr. Hossein Arab Ahmadi, along with two other people, was
    reported by HRANA Website, the Human Rights Activists News Agency
    (September 26, 2016). Mr. Arab Ahmadi was 27 years old, and his case was
    related to illegal drug crimes committed in 2007. He was 18 when these
    crimes were committed. Arrest and detention Mr. Arab Ahmadi spent 9 years
    in prison. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Arab Ahmadi s trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Arab Ahmadi was crimes related to illegal drugs
    . The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands
    of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following
    judicial processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of
    them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences
    on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Arab Ahmadi s defense. Judgment Mr. Hossein Arab Ahmadi was sentenced
    to death by hanging. He was executed, along with one other person*, in
    Shahrud Prison - Semnan Province, on Thursday, September 22, 2016.
