    Mr. Shemirani was in charge of the Kataeb Navadegan Salahuddin Ayyubi
    party s public relations and editor-in-chief of the Jihad website. News of
    Mr. Ali Abdolkarim Shemirani and 24 other individuals execution was
    published by various sources including IRNA (August 3, 2016), IRIB News
    Agency (August 3, 2016), Fars News Agency (August 2, 2016), Khorassan
    Newspaper (August 4, 2016), HRANA (August 3, 2016), Kurdistan Human Rights
    Defenders Center (August 3, 2016), and the Amnesty International Report
    (November 17, 2016). Additional information about this execution was
    obtained from an Information Ministry Announcement (Islamic Republic of
    Iran Information Ministry website, August 3, 2016), Kurdistan Province
    Judiciary Announcement (Fars New Agency, August 2, 2016), and from other
    sources.* Mr. Ali Abdolkarim Shemirani, also known as Ali Mojahed , was 37
    years old, a Sunni Kurd from the [town of] Halabcheh s village of Kuku-ye
    Shahmiraneh in Iraqi Kurdistan. He was a member of the Islamist party
    Kataeb Navadegan Salahuddin Ayyubi in Iranian Kurdistan. Mr. Shemirani was
    married and had two children. Based on available information, Mr.
    Shemirani was in charge of the Kataeb Navadegan Salahuddin Ayyubi Islamist
    party s public relations and editor-in-chief of the Jihad website, that
    party s official website. (NRT Network, August 5, 2016) According to the
    Amnesty International report, security forces threatened Mr. Shemirani s
    family and lawyers in order to prevent them from releasing information
    about the cases and to stop them from giving interviews to media and human
    rights organizations. Kataeb Navadegan Salahuddin Ayyubi After the U.S.
    and Patriotic Union of Iraqi Kurdistan Party s attack in 2003-04 against
    regions under the influence of the Islamist party Ansar al-Islam in the
    Uramanat regions of Iraqi Kurdistan, a number of this party s members fled
    to Iranian Kurdistan. This group had been formed in 2000-01 with the
    coalition of several small Islamist groups. Based on available
    information, a number of Afghan Mujahidin participated in this group,
    which was also linked with al-Qaeda. Ansar-al-Islam was opposed to the
    influence and power of secular groups in Iraqi Kurdistan and demanded a
    return to the time of Islam s inception. The group advocated [the Islamic
    concept of] Nahy-e az Monkar ( forbidding what is sinful ). Based on
    available information, Jihad ( Holy War ) against secularism and apostasy
    was this group s priority. A number of previous members of the Islamist
    group Kataeb Fathi , linked with Ansar-al-Islam, established a group
    called Kataeb Kurdistan in Iran. Between 2005 and 2008, this group
    conducted several military operations against Patriotic Union of Iraqi
    Kurdistan forces in the Iran-Iraq border region. Thereafter, Iran s
    Information forces arrested several of this group s leaders and sentenced
    them all to 11 years in prison; they were released, however, in 2013-14.
    Some of Kataeb Kurdistan s members separated from the group in 2007-08 and
    established the Islamist group Kataeb Navadegan Salahuddin Ayyubi which
    held Jihadi and Salafi beliefs. (Boroumand Foundation research).
    Background Based on available information, in the years 2007 to 2009-10,
    Shi a evangelists hurled numerous insults at Sunni beliefs and Sunni
    respected figures, with severe backlash from Sunni religious figures and
    activists. Following famous Shi a movie director Ebrahim Hatamikia s
    offensive statements about Aisha, the Prophet s wife, in Khanevadeye Sabz
    ( Green Family ) Magazine (Volume 195, 2007-08), and statements made by
    several well-known preachers such as Hojjatoleslams Daneshmand, Juybari,
    and Ansari whose speeches were covered by [IRIB,] state radio and
    television in certain instances a number of religious Sunni youth from
    Kurdistan (who considered these insults as being organized) proceeded to
    hold classes, distribute books and CD s in local mosques, universities,
    and their neighborhoods, protesting against these actions and raising
    awareness, as well as promoting and defending the tenets of the Shafe i
    religion.** These CD s contained documented instances of offensive
    language used against Sunni beliefs, quoted from well-known religious
    sources of the Shi a religion such as Bohar-ol-Anvar. The religious
    activities of these young people raised the security apparatus
    sensitivity. Subsequent to Ayatollah Khamenei s trip to Sanandaj in
    April-May 2009, several young Sunni Kurd religious activists were arrested
    in the name of fighting Salafi and Takfiri (term used to denote Sunni
    extremists such as al-Qaeda and ISIS) movements. Three months later, a
    number of assassinations were carried out in Sanandaj, including Mamusta
    Sheikh-ol-Eslam, member of the Assembly of Experts, and Molla Borhan Aali,
    a Sunni cleric. Security forces accused certain individuals of murder, who
    had already been arrested prior to these assassinations. Security forces
    also accused certain individuals of murder, who had been arrested after
    these a
