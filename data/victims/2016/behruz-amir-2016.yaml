    The execution of Mr. Amir Behruz was reported by HRANA Website, Human
    Rights Activists News Agency, and Kurdistan Center for Democracy and Human
    Rights Website (September 26, 2016). Additional information on this case
    was gathered from HRANA Website (September 25, 2016). Mr. Behruz was
    Kurdish and his case was related to murder. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Behruz was taken to solitary confinement on September 25, 2016. He had
    previously been taken to solitary confinement, but had been returned to
    the prison section following a reprieve. The circumstances of his arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Behruz s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Behruz was murder
    in the first degree . The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Behruz s defense. Judgment Mr. Amir Behruz was sentenced
    to death by hanging. He was executed in the Central Prison of Orumieh, on
    Monday September 26, 2016.
