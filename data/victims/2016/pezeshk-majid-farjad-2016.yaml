    s interview with one of his cellmates in Karaj s Central Prison on July
    20, 25, and 26, 2016 and an electronic form sent to the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center by one of Mr. Farjad Pezeshk s friends on November 23,
    2017 (Electronic Form). The news of this execution was confirmed by an
    informed person who spoke with a staff member at Karaj s Central Prison.
    Additional information about this execution was obtained through
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interview with a relative of Mr. Farjad
    Pezeshk s co-defendant (Mr. Jamshid Dini) on July 17, 2018 (ABC
    interview). Mr. Farjad Pezeshk resided in the city of Gohardasht in Alborz
    Province. Mr. Farjad Pezeshk s case pertained to drug-related offences in
    2012 in the city of Karaj. Mr. Farjad Pezeshk s house was under
    surveillance by agents of the Drug Control Headquarters for some time, and
    they raided Mr. Farjad Pezeshk s house and arrested him. Arrest and
    detention According to available information, Mr. Farjad Pezeshk s house
    was under surveillance by agents of the Drug Control Headquarters for some
    time. On the afternoon of Sunday, September 9, 2012, agents of the Drug
    Control Headquarters in the city of Karaj raided Mr. Farjad Pezeshk s
    house, arrested him, and transferred him to the Ministry of Information
    office. After a few days, Mr. Farjad Pezeshk was transferred from the
    Ministry of Information office s detention center to the fourth dormitory
    in the Central Prison in Karaj, where he was held for four years. Several
    days prior to the implementation of the court order, Mr. Farjad Pezeshk
    was transferred to solitary confinement in Karaj Central Prison. Mr.
    Farjad Pezeshk s last visit with his family took place one day before the
    implementation of the court order (ABC interview). Trial On September 16,
    2012, Branch 4 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Karaj tried Mr.
    Farjad Pezeshk and the co-defendant in the case (Mr. Jamshid Dini) in one
    session. The trial session for both defendants in this case lasted less
