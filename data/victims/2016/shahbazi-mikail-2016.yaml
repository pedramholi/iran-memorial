    News of the execution of Mr. Mika il Shahbazi, son of Ruhollah, was taken
    from the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation research based on the case
    documents and interviews with several informed sources on May 24, 2016.
    Mr. Shahbazi was born in Khalkhal, Ardebil, in 1977. He resided in Alborz
    province for years and lived in Fardis, Karaj where he married. He was
    raised in a crowded family and was an independent individual who had
    worked since adolescence. Mr. Shahbazi was a high school graduate. He
    owned a butcher shop, and was married with a nine-year-old daughter.
    According to people close to him, he was an independent, kind, and
    supportive individual. The case of Mr. Shahbazi was related to narcotics.
    According to people close to him, he always worked for his living and had
    no tendency towards narcotics. However, due to economic problems he
    accepted a friend s offer to produce narcotics. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Shahbazi was arrested, along with another person, by agents of the Drug
    Control and Intelligence Ministry Office in Alborz Province in an aviary,
    allegedly a lab to produce methamphetamine, on February 14, 2013.
    Authorities did not inform his family and only acknowledged his detention
    several days after the family s repeated visits. He was first detained and
    interrogated in the Intelligence Prison in Raja ishahr. Then, after about
    a month, he was transferred to the Karaj (Nedamatgah) Prison where he was
    detained for more than 3 years in Section 2 of this prison. According to
    the existing information, he was able to visit his wife after a month.
    After that, he had a monthly visitation in cabin and a visitation in
    person with his wife and daughter every three months. Trial Branch Four of
    the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Karaj, with judge Farajollahi
    presiding, tried Mr. Shahbazi. His family introduced an attorney shortly
    before the court session began. This attorney went once to the Karaj
    Prison to visit his client and get the power of attorney. In July of 2013,
    attorneys of both defendants participated in the court session that took
    only 30 minutes. According to an informed source, Mr. Shahbazi s attorney
    was not allowed to explain the case and defend his client verbally. Based
    on the court ruling, the arresting agents reported that Mika il Shahbazi
    and the other defendant had been arrested while producing methamphetamine.
    The aviary in which they were arrested had been rented by the other
    defendant. No information is available about the interrogation style
    during the preliminary investigation at the Public Prosecutor s Office.
    After the indictment was issued, the case was referred to the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Karaj. Charges The charges brought against Mr.
    Shahbazi were production and possession of 6 kilograms and 150 grams of
    methamphetamine. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to the verdict against Mr. Shahbazi and another person, the
    arresting agents recovered and confiscated methamphetamine and production
    tools. In addition, it is stated that the defendants made several
    confessions during interrogation in the Intelligence Office. International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    In his defense during the trial, Mr. Shahbazi claimed that the recovered
    narcotics did not belong to him and rejected the charges. According to the
    indictment regarding the recovered narcotics, each defendant claims that
    the narcotics belong to the other one. According to an informed source,
    the recovered narcotics were not offered to be sold and Mr. Shahbazi had
    made no income out of it. He also had no criminal record. Brief Legal
    Objections Regarding Mr. Shahbazi s Trial 1-According to the court ruling
    issued by Branch Four of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Karaj, Mr.
    Mika il Shahbazi only confessed to producing methamphet
