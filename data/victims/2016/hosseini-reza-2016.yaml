    News of the execution of Mr. Reza Hosseini known as Haji, son of Karam,
    along with three others, was published on the website of HRANA (Human
    Rights Activists News Agency) on May 3, 2016. Additional information,
    including the Public Prosecutor s Office documents, the court ruling, and
    his will, were taken from HRANA on May 9, 2016 and a YouTube video
    reflecting statements by Mr. Hosseini s wife.. Mr. Hosseini, 34, was from
    Kuhdasht in Lorestan. He was married, a Tehran resident, and a
    professional. He was condemned for narcotics charges. Arrest and detention
    Around 11 a.m. on a day in the summer of 2013 (sometime before September 6
    when he was already in custody), agents who intended to arrest their
    neighbor, got into a verbal argument with Mr. Hossein in the parking lot
    of their building. They beat him up and arrested him. Agents broke into
    the neighbor s apartment, took some boxes, and claimed that they
    discovered some plastic bags containing narcotics from Mr. Hosseini.
    According to his wife, he was interrogated and tortured for 70 days during
    that period. We could not visit him. Then he was transferred to Qezelhesar
    Prison where we were not allowed to visit him for 11 months. Authorities
    mistreated the family during visits whenever they found out that Mr.
    Hosseini s birth place was Kuhdasht in Lorestan. Trial Branch 30 of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran tried Mr. Hosseini on February 16,
    2014. His attorney objected to the death penalty ruling; however, his
    objection was denied by the General Public Prosecutors Office (an official
    document issued on November 29, 2014). According to Mr. Hosseini s wife,
    the court session took only a few minutes during which the judge asked
    about his identity and in response to Mr. Hosseini s claim of innocence,
    stated: If you are innocent, you will go to heaven after the execution!
    Charges According to the court official documents, the charges brought
    against Mr. Hosseini were announced as purchasing morphine, producing
    heroin, with intention of selling them, and possession of 140 kilograms
    and 305 grams of heroin and morphine. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt According to the court documents, Mr. Hosseini carried two plastic
    bags containing 2 kilograms and 960 grams of bagged heroin on the day of
    his arrest. In addition, a digital weighing scale and a total of 16.85
    million Tumans cash were recovered from his apartment and after agents
    followed up, it became clear that Reza Hosseini had the keys to the next
    apartment. while searching that apartment, a total of 77.89 kilograms of
    bagged heroin were discovered in the refrigerator and 64.14 kilograms of
    bagged heroin, skillfully placed in 62 bags in 4 boxes, were discovered
    and confiscated from the bedroom. Defense Mr. Hosseini always expressed
    his innocence and claimed that the narcotics did not belong to him.
    According to his wife, the narcotics mentioned in the case were recovered
    from the neighbor s apartment and we did not know them. The reason for
    arresting Reza was his physical clash with agents in the parking lot of
    our building. The case inspector also told the family several times that
    Mr. Hosseini would be exonerated because of his innocence. In his will,
    Mr. Hosseini wrote: My charge was not proven, even to myself, during my
    detention period. In which of God s books is stated that issuing a death
    sentence for a young man including interrogation and court session should
    take only 2 minutes and then the judge issues a death sentence against a
    young man in cold blood? Judgment The court condemned Mr. Reza Hosseini to
    death and confiscation of his belongings. The General Public Prosecutors
    Office confirmed the ruling on November 29, 2014. He was hanged, along
    with three other prisoners with drug related charges, at Unit One of the
    Qezelhesar Prison in Karaj on May 3, 2016. He had been transferred from
    the Tehran Prison (Feshafuyeh) to Qezelhesar Prison to be executed. He was
    not allowed to visit his wife and family, who had travelled a long way,
    for a last time. According to
