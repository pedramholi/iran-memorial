    He was a retired employee of the Penjwin Forestry Department. After
    learning about the ideology of Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the
    Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), he left the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.
    Information regarding the extrajudicial execution of Kamal Sadeq Qader,
    also known as Kamal Sheikh Sadeq, son of Tali'eh and Sadeq, was gathered
    from an interview conducted by the Boroumand Center with one of his close
    associates (on April 20, 2021), legal documents, including the verdict
    issued by the Second Criminal Court of Sulaymaniyah in Iraqi Kurdistan,
    and the verdict issued by the Kurdistan Region Court of Appeal. The legal
    brief submitted to the court by the lawyers of Kamal Sadeq Qader's case,
    as well as interviews with Mr. Kamal Sadeq Qader and his wife with the
    Kurdish TV channel, Aryen TV (unknown date) and other sources* were also
    used as additional sources. Kamal Sadeq Qader was born on January 2, 1967,
    in Penjwin, in the province of Sulaimaniyah, Iraqi Kurdistan, to a
    relatively poor Kurdish family. He completed his education up to primary
    level, got married, and had four children. (ABC interview with an informed
    source, April 20, 2021, and interview with Kamal Sadeq on Aryen TV) In
    1983, as a teenager, Kamal Sadeq Qader joined the Peshmerga forces of the
    Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). In early 1990, he was arrested along
    with five of his friends by the Ba'athist government of Iraq and
    imprisoned for three years in the cities of Sulaimaniyah, Mosul, and Abu
    Ghraib prison. In 1992, after the autonomy of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq
    and the exchange of prisoners of war between the Iraqi government and the
    Kurdish parties, he was released along with several other political
    prisoners. After his release, he rejoined the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
    and worked for two years at the customs office in the Chamchamal region,
    Serteki Bemo, and the customs office in the city of Darbandikhan. In 1994,
    Kamal Sadeq Qader returned to Penjwin and began working in the Asayish
    (Internal Security) Department of the Kurdistan Region. From 2005 to 2007,
    he was in charge of the Forest and Rangeland Forces in Penjwin. In 2007,
    after becoming aware of Abdullah Ocalan's thoughts, he resigned from the
    Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and joined the Kurdistan Democratic Solution
    Party, which was more in line with Ocalan's ideology. After this
    resignation, Kamal Sadeq Qader earned his living through construction and
    renting out shops. Despite his official resignation from his former party,
    he continued to receive his monthly salary according to the laws of the
    Kurdistan Region. (ABC interview, April 20, 2021) At the same time as
    joining the Kurdistan Solution Party, Kamal Sadeq Qader also established
    ties with the Free Life Party of Kurdistan (PJAK). He cooperated with PJAK
    in providing supplies to the party and relocating its members to different
    areas of Kurdistan. Initially, he was only a supporter and sympathizer of
    the party, but he officially became a member at the 3rd PJAK Congress in
    2008. According to an informed source, through his efforts, some of his
    former friends and party members from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
    were also drawn to PJAK. Influenced by Abdullah Ocalan's ideas, all
    members of his family eventually joined PJAK. His wife became a board
    member of the PJAK Women's Union, and two of his children were members of
    PJAK until his assassination in 2016. (ABC Interview, April 20, 2021)
    According to an interview with Kamal Sadeq Qader on Aryen TV, after his
    resignation he came under pressure from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
    because of his links to PJAK. On April 17, 2011, he was arrested by
    Asayish (Internal Security Directorate of the Kurdistan Region) during
    protests in Penjwin district against corruption and the governance of the
    Kurdistan Regional Government. He was tortured and handed over to the
    intelligence services of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, where he was
    detained for 15 days in Joolakan prison in Sulaimaniyah. He was finally
    released after a six-day hunger strike. (Interview with Kamal Sadeq Qader
    on Aryen TV) In 2013, Kamal Sadeq Qader was listed as a candidate for the
    Kurdistan Democratic Solution Party in the elections for the Kurdistan
    Regional Parliament, but he did not win a seat (The book "A Blossom from
    the Tree of Freedom - A Memoir for Kamal Penjwini", Summer 2017). In the
    same year, he became active in the diplomatic section of the PJAK party
    and represented the party in discussions with other individuals and
    political groups in Kurdistan. He also played an important role in
    organizing PJAK forces and helping to deploy them in the border mountains
    between Penjwin and Iran. His extensive knowledge of the region and strong
    connections allowed him to play a key role in providing food and
    ammunition to the party's forces in the border areas of Penjwin, as PJAK
    had previously been unable to establish a presence or operate in these
    areas. (ABC interview, April 20, 2
