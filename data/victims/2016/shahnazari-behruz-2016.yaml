    Because of his serene demeanor, Mr. Shahnazari s friends had been calling
    him Aram ( Serene ) since he was 15 years old News of Mr. Behruz
    Shahnazari and 24 other individuals execution was published by various
    sources including IRNA (August 3, 2016), IRIB News Agency (August 3,
    2016), Fars News Agency (August 2, 2016), Khorassan Newspaper (August 4,
    2016), HRANA (August 3, 2016), Kurdistan Human Rights Defenders Center
    (August 3, 2016), and the Amnesty International Report (November 17,
    2016). Additional information about this execution was obtained through
    the Boroumand Foundation s interview with a person close to Mr.
    Shahnazari, from an Information Ministry Announcement (Islamic Republic of
    Iran Information Ministry website, August 3, 2016), Kurdistan Province
    Judiciary Announcement (Fars New Agency, August 2, 2016), from Mr.
    Shahnazari s video message recorded in prison and broadcast on YouTube
    (August 22, 2016), and from other sources.* Mr. Behruz Shahnazari, also
    known as Aram, was 31 years old and from the [city of] Sanandaj. He was a
    Sunni Kurd, single, and residing in Sanandaj s Golshan neighborhood. He
    had a high school diploma with a concentration in the sciences. He had no
    occupation other than studying religious subject matters of the Sunni
    faith in Sanandaj and Zahedan. Prior to his arrest, he had gone to [the
    city of] Zahedan s seminaries several times to study Sunni theology.
    According to an acquaintance, Mr. Shahnazari was a religious man, a
    follower of the Shafe i** branch of Islam, but was not affiliated with any
    particular group or organization, and taught cantillation of the Koran at
    the mosque, his home, and his students homes. Because of his serene
    demeanor, Mr. Shahnazari s friends had been calling him Aram ( Serene )
    since he was 15 years old. (Boroumand Foundation interview). Sunni
    defendants families correspondence, including Mr. Shahnazari s, with the
    Leader, the Head of the Judiciary, and the President, as well as sit-ins
    and follow-ups with the authorities in protesting the arrest and issuance
    of a death sentence, bore no fruit. According to the Amnesty International
    report, security forces threatened Mr. Shahnazari s family and lawyers in
    order to prevent them from releasing information about the cases and to
    stop them from giving interviews to media and human rights organizations.
    Background Based on available information, in the years 2007 to 2009-10,
    Shi a evangelists hurled numerous insults at Sunni beliefs and Sunni
    respected figures, with severe backlash from Sunni religious figures and
    activists. Following famous Shi a movie director Ebrahim Hatamikia s
    offensive statements about Aisha, the Prophet s wife, in Khanevadeye Sabz
    ( Green Family ) Magazine (Volume 195, 2007-08), and statements made by
    several well-known preachers such as Hojjatoleslams Daneshmand, Juybari,
    and Ansari whose speeches were covered by [IRIB,] state radio and
    television in certain instances a number of religious Sunni youth from
    Kurdistan (who considered these insults as being organized) proceeded to
    hold classes, distribute books and CD s in local mosques, universities,
    and their neighborhoods, protesting against these actions and raising
    awareness, as well as promoting and defending the tenets of the Shafe i
    religion.** These CD s contained documented instances of offensive
    language used against Sunni beliefs, quoted from well-known religious
    sources of the Shi a religion such as Bohar-ol-Anvar. The religious
    activities of these young people raised the security apparatus
    sensitivity. Subsequent to Ayatollah Khamenei s trip to Sanandaj in
    April-May 2009, several young Sunni Kurd religious activists were arrested
    in the name of fighting Salafi and Takfiri (term used to denote Sunni
    extremists such as al-Qaeda and ISIS) movements. Three months later, a
    number of assassinations were carried out in Sanandaj, including Mamusta
    Sheikh-ol-Eslam, member of the Assembly of Experts, and Molla Borhan Aali,
    a Sunni cleric. Security forces accused certain individuals of murder, who
    had already been arrested prior to these assassinations. The arrestees
    denied any connection to armed, extremist, or radical groups, objected to
    the charges brought against them, and asked for a new and public trial, to
    no avail. Ultimately, six of the arrestees were executed in December
    2012-January 2013, and six others on March 4, 2015. Also, continuing this
    process, 25 others, named the Unity and Jihad Group , were put to death on
    August 2, 2016. The issuance and implementation of the death penalty for
    this group of Sunni adherents, was followed by the reaction of numerous
    domestic and international individuals and organizations. On June 12,
    2014, eighteen human rights organizations, including the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Foundation and a human rights lawyer, protested the sentences in
    a declaration and demanded that they be rescinded. Furthermore, Amnesty
    International, Human Rights Watch, Human Rights Defenders, and the
    Abdorrah
