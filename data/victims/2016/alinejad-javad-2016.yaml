    News and information about the execution of Mr. Javad Alinejad was
    obtained from an Abdorrahman Boroumand Center interview with two informed
    sources, on July 20, 2016 and July 21, 2016. News of this execution was
    also published in Iran newspaper on July 21, 2016. Additional information
    was gleaned from the court s verdict, recorded in the Boroumand Center
    archives. According to available information, Mr. Alinejad was from Bandar
    Abbas and resided in Karaj. He was married and he resided in Karaj (ABC
    Interview, July 20 and 21, 2016). Mr. Alinejad s case was related to drug
    offenses. Arrest and detention The circumstances and exact details of Mr.
    Alinejad s arrest and detention are not known. The public revolutionary
    prosecutor of Karaj, Reza Shakarami, gave an interview to Iran newspaper.
    In this interview he explained how four individuals, including Mr.
    Alinejad, were arrested in an underground workshop during a strike
    operation, after being identified by drug enforcement officers of Alborz
    Province (Iran Newspaper, July 21, 2016). Mr. Alinejad was incarcerated in
    Hall #2 at Karaj Penitentiary (Interview with Center, July 20 and 21,
    2016). Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Karaj tried Mr. Alinejad.
    There is no information on the date of this court. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Alinejad was related to drugs. In his interview, the
    Karaj Prosecutor did not mention a specific charge against Mr. Alinejad
    (Iran Newspaper, July 21, 2016). The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt According to the Karaj Prosecutor, during the raid on the workshop
    where Mr. Alinejad and three other people were apprehended, one kilogram
    crystal meth was found and impounded. During further investigations, it
    was determined that these individuals had several criminal records,
    including narcotics smuggling . The prosecutor did not give any details
    about these criminal records or about Mr. Alinejad s personal record (Iran
    Newspaper, July 21, 2016). International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Alinejad s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Karaj
    sentenced Mr. Alinejad to execution by hanging. This verdict was approved
    by the Supreme Court. Mr. Alinejad s death sentence was carried out on
    July 19, 2016, in the Central Karaj Penitentiary courtyard (ABC Interview,
    July 20 and 21, 2016; Iran Newspaper, July 21, 2016). Mr. Alinejad had a
    visitation with his family a day before he was hanged. (ABC Interview,
    July 20 and 21, 2016; Iran Newspaper, July 21, 2016)
