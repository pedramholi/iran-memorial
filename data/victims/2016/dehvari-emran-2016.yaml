    A few days before his death, Mr. Emran Dehvari informed his wife that he
    had noticed his personal closet had been forcibly opened at the hospital.
    He observed signs of impact and damage on the closet's lock. Information
    about the case of Dr. Emran Dehvari, son of Ali and Jannat, hailing from
    Khash city in Sistan and Baluchestan province, who was married and had one
    child, was obtained from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center with Mr. An'am Dehvari, one of his brothers (on July 24,
    2023 and October 20, 2023). To complement the details of this case, data
    from the websites of the Baloch activists' campaign (December 17,21 and
    25, 2016), Iran Wire (January 26, 2017), the IslamTape website (January
    29, 2024), and the YouTube channel of NourTV (December 28, 2016) were also
    consulted. Mr. Dehvari was born on September 16, 1989, into a well-known
    and devout Sunni Baloch family. He spent his formative years in Saravan
    city. Mr. Dehvari moved to Zahedan for high school and initially attended
    a prestigious model high school affiliated with the Ministry of Science
    and Zahedan University, which required an entrance exam. However, after
    two years, he returned to his hometown of Saravan and resumed his studies
    at Dar al-Hadith Imam Bukhari Religious School. His father, Mr. Sheikh Ali
    Dehvari, established this institution for individuals interested in
    religious sciences. According to his brother, Mr. Dehvari developed an
    interest in religious activities during his high school years. (Interview
    with An am Dehvari, July 24, 2023) After completing high school, Mr. Emran
    Dehvari took part in the Iranian University Entrance Exam and was accepted
    into the medical field. He enrolled at Zahedan University of Medical
    Sciences. His admission to the medical university coincided with the peak
    of his father's religious and political activities. Emran's father, Mr.
    Sheikh Ali Dehvari, a prominent Sunni cleric in Baluchestan and the
    founder of the "Dar al-Hadith Imam Bukhari School" in Saravan city, was
    assassinated by two unidentified armed motorcycle riders on November 10,
    2008, while visiting a mosque in Saravan city. Mr. Emran Dehvari was
    actively involved in religious activities while pursuing his medical
    studies. Following his father's assassination, he served as a member of
    the management council at his father's school for an extended period. Mr.
    Dehvari, a Hafiz (one who memorizes the Qur'an), assumed the
    responsibility of leading congregations at his father's educational
    centers and mosques, including "Dar al-Hadith Imam Bukhari School" and
    "Umar Farooq Mosque" in Saravan. Additionally, during Ramadan, he
    participated in ceremonies such as "Tarawih" (special religious gatherings
    for Sunnis during Ramadan). With his "good manners" and "high social
    appeal," he cultivated strong relationships with Zahedan missionaries and
    other Sunni followers across the country. Through online platforms like
    Paltak (an older platform for audio-visual conversations, akin to
    Clubhouse), he maintained contact with Sunni youth in various regions,
    including Hormozgan and Kurdistan. (Interview with An am Dehvari, October
    20, 2023) In addition to contributing articles to "Sunnat Magazine,"* Mr.
    Dehvari compiled three collections of articles on Sunni hadiths (the
    IslamTape website, January 29, 2024) Moreover, conducting religious
    classes in Zahedan University's dormitory was among his other activities
    during this period, ultimately resulting in his expulsion from the
    dormitory. (Interview with An am Dehvari, July 24, 2023) Mr. Emran Dehvari
    worked at "Imam Ali Zahedan Hospital" during the final years of his
    medical studies. According to his brother, Mr. Dehvari harbored many
    sensitivities regarding medical ethics and the "normalization of human
    death by physicians." Describing Emran as a "quiet yet dynamic and active"
    individual, his brother noted that despite Emran's belief that the Islamic
    Republic was responsible for his father's assassination, he advocated for
    avoiding emotional reactions and instead emphasized the use of "wisdom" to
    move forward. In the last two years of his life, his focus shifted from
    religious activities to social endeavors, such as providing medical
    services in underserved and rural areas. This transition led him to halt
    the writing of religious materials, channeling his efforts into medical
    work. Consequently, among the people, he became more commonly known as an
    "elite," a "social face," and a "respected individual" rather than a
    "religious figure." (Interview with An am Dehvari, July 24, 2023) The
    Situation of Iran s Baloch Population Baluch ethnics make up one to three
    percent of the country s population and the majority in Sistan and
    Baluchistan, where 64-77 percent of residents live below the poverty line.
    Despite having abundant gas, oil, gold, and marine resources,
    approximately two-thirds of residents lack access to clean drinking water.
