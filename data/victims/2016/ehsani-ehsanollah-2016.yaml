    Mr. Ehsani was a 20-year-old Afghan living in Yazd who liked to play
    soccer News of Mr. Ehsanollah Ehsani s death was published by HRANA News
    Agency on May 22, 2016. Additional information was obtained through
    Boroumand Foundation research and interviews conducted with persons with
    knowledge of the case including Mr. Ehsani s brother. Mr. Ehsanollah
    Ehsani, child of Ali Khan, was born on March 21, 1996 in Afghanistan s
    Ghazni Province, Qarabagh District. He was 20 years old, an Afghanistan
    national, and of Hazara ethnicity. Due to the lack of security in
    Afghanistan, he migrated to Iran as a child with his mother, two sisters,
    and three brothers. Iran shares a 937-kilometer border with Afghanistan as
    well as a common language with a significant part of the people of that
    country: for this reason, Iran has absorbed through its borders one of the
    largest mass movement of populations in the world. Millions of people fled
    Afghanistan in order to escape war, oppression, and insecurity when
    Afghanistan was under Soviet occupation between 1979 and 1989, as well as
    during the country s civil wars, especially after the Taliban s rise to
    power in 1996. They took refuge mainly in Iran and Pakistan.* Prior to his
    family s migration to Iran, Mr. Ehsani s father had been living in the
    country for years: he had a Basij membership card and had fought on the
    Iranian side during the Iran-Iraq war. Mr. Ehsani resided in Yazd s
    Rahmatabad neighborhood and had a legal residence card and a work permit.
    Mr. Ehsani came from a large and relatively poor family and had a
    sixth-grade education, having dropped out of school due to discriminatory
    and degrading treatment. He subsequently started to work with his father
    and his brother to help out his family. He worked as a welder and mason
    and had started a coffee shop with one of his Iranian friends in the last
    months of his life where he worked in the afternoon. Mr. Ehsani was a
    quiet and fairly serious person. He loved his mother very much and tried
    hard to make her happy and comfortable. He did not want to leave Iran
    because of his mother, but he sometimes thought about leaving and said
    that he wanted to save money to go to Canada. He liked sports and football
    (soccer) and played on his neighborhood s team. He would go to his brother
    s home at times to watch football games with his brother s family. Mr.
    Ehsanollah Ehsani s case is related to theft of a motorcycle and carrying
    an illegal taser. Arrest and detention Mr. Ehsani was arrested by Zarej
    Police Precinct officers on Friday, May 13, 2016, while he was sitting in
    a park waiting to join his friend for a football game. The officers
    realized he had an open case for the theft of a motorcycle while checking
    to ascertain his identification. Five months prior to this arrest, several
    Yazd Criminal Investigations officers had gone to Mr. Ehsani s home
    sometime in December 2015 at 9:00 PM in a silver Peugeot 405 automobile.
    They then arrested him without providing a warrant, handcuffed him, and
    took him to the Yazd Criminal Investigations Bureau located at Azadi
    Square. The Yazd Criminal Investigations Bureau identified Mr. Ehsani
    riding a motorcycle and carrying another person on his bike through city
    camera footage. Mr. Ehsani s mother and brother went to the Yazd Criminal
    Investigations Bureau after his arrest to follow up on his case. On the
    second day they went there, they met with him by chance for a few minutes
    in one of the administrative rooms. Mr. Ehsani told his family that he had
    been interrogated and tortured to make a confession. Mr. Ehsani s brother
    recounted that his brother was in very bad shape during that visit and
    quoted his brother as saying: They tell me that I have stolen; I have done
    nothing, I just picked someone up and took him somewhere. He was the
    thief, he had stolen the motorcycle, and they think I was his accomplice.
    They torture me without giving me food and water; they want me to admit
    that I have committed ten crimes and to confess to them so that they ll
    stop torturing me. They say they will help me out and will tell the court
    that I cooperated and that because I m young, they will ask the court to
    give me a lighter sentence. According to Mr. Ehsani s brother, he was
    extremely hungry, thirsty, and pale when they saw him. His mother wanted
    to give him a piece of cake she had in her bag but they did not allow him
    to eat it and said that it was prohibited. Mr. Ehsani s mother and brother
    visited with him while he was being taken by four Criminal Investigations
    officers in a silver Peugeot 405 to identify several robbery locations. In
    response to Mr. Ehsani s mother asking where they were taking him, the
    officers said: We re taking him for a drive. When he went back on the
    third day, the Criminal Investigations officers told Mr. Ehsani s brother
    that they had transferred him to Yazd Central Prison. During his
    detention, Mr. Ehsani visited with his family on Sundays from behind a
    glass window for less than
