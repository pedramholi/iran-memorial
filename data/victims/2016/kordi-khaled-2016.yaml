    When he was 17, Mr. Khaled Kordi accepted an offer to carry an unknown
    person s bag in exchange for a free trip to Isfahan. He did not know that
    the bag contained methamphetamines. News of the execution of Mr. Khaled
    Kordi and one other person was published on the website of the Baluch
    Activists Campaign (January 27, 2016.) Additional information was taken
    from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with a
    person close to Kordi (ABF interview.) Mr. Kordi was a Baluch adolescent
    from Khash in Sistan Va Baluchestan province. He attended school until the
    seventh grade but could not continue his education due to being older than
    the permitted age. He worked as a laborer with his father, who transported
    construction materials using a Nissan truck. According to a person close
    to him, Mr. Kordi s family were local nomads: in accordance with common
    practice of that community, they had used the birth certificate of his
    dead brother, five years his senior, for Kordi himself. According to
    people close to Kordi, he was a healthy and shy young man who had no
    criminal record (ABF interview.) Mr. Kordi s case was related to the
    recovery of narcotics from a bag that he carried traveling from Kerman to
    Esfahan. He was 17 years and 3 months of age when arrested. International
    laws strictly prohibit the use of capital punishment against those under
    the age of 18 at the time of committing a crime. As a party to the
    Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of
    the Child, Iran is bound to abstain from capital punishment in the cases
    of such juvenile offenders. Arrest and detention In 2008 Mr. Kordi and his
    friend were arrested by police at a checkpoint outside of Kerman while on
    their way to Isfahan in a hired car. Kordi was detained at Yazd Prison for
    seven years. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    His family could only visit him every six weeks due to the long distance
    between their residence and Yazd Prison (ABF interview.) Trial The Mehriz
    Court in Yazd province tried Mr. Kordi and the other defendant. A public
    defender represented him during the trial (ABF interview.) Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Kordi was announced as carrying
    methamphetamines. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Kordi demonstrated that he was carrying 4 kilograms and 300 grams of
    methamphetamine at the time of arrest. Defense According to a person close
    to him, Mr. Kordi rejected the charge against him. During the
    interrogation and trial, he clearly stated that the narcotics recovered
    from the bags that he and his friends were carrying did not belong to
    them. An unknown person approached them in a square in Kerman and offered
    to arrange for free car travel to Isfahan in exchange for transporting the
    bags. Kordi and his friend were not made aware of their contents (ABF
    interview.) According to a person close to Kordi, the judge and Public
    Prosecutor of Mehriz were convinced that the recovered narcotics did not
    belong to Mr. Kordi and his friend and they had been deceived by the
    stranger. Given the considerable volume of narcotics in question, however,
    they found themselves legally constrained. Owing to financial limitations,
    Mr. Kordi s family could not hire an attorney and had to refer his case to
    a public defender. They asked the court to investigate their claim
    regarding the birth certificate belonging to Mr. Kordi s older brother
    which demonstrated that Kordi was in fact younger than 18 years old.
    According to the family, Mr. Kordi was sent to the forensics office in
    Yazd three times; due to the large size of his body, the forensics doctor
    could not confirm his age. When the family objected, the case was referred
    to the forensics office in Kerman for the fourth time. Due to various
    problems including long distance and bureaucracy Mr. Kordi was not able to
    present for the doctor s visit (ABF interview.) Judgment The Mehriz Court
    condemned Mr. Khaled Kordi and his friend to death. The judicial
    authorities confirmed the ruling. According to a person close to Kordi,
    the judge and the Public Prosecutor had petitioned the judiciary to pardon
    or commute his sentence several times but their requests were rejected.
    Mr. Kordi was hanged along with his friend in Yazd Central Prison on the
    morning of Monday, January 25, 2016. According to a person close to him,
    his family was told just two days earlier to come visit him for the last
    time: Kordi was unable to meet with them due to a large number of
    visitors, however. He was only able to see his father for a few minutes
    inside a vehicle (ABF interview.) According to a person close to him, the
    Public Prosecutor of Mehriz had postponed the carrying out of the sentence
    in order to give the family time to obtain results. A new Public
    Prosecutor was assigned, however, and the ruling was ultimately executed
    (ABF interview.)
