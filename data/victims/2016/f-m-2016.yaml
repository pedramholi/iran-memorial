    News of the execution of Mr. M. F., son of Sharif Ali, along with three
    other individuals* was announced by the website of the provincial Ministry
    of Justice office of Gilan Province (January 16, 2016) citing the Public
    Relations section of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Gilan
    Province. Mr. M.F. s case pertains to trafficking illegal drugs. Arrest
    and detention There is no information available on the details of Mr. M.
    F. s arrest and detention. Trial Mr. M. F. was tried in the presence of
    his defense lawyer by the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Gilan Province.
    However, there is no information available on the details of the session
    or sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. M. F. was charged with trafficking
    narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    Possessing 741 grams of crack was entered as evidence of guilt against Mr.
    M. F. Defense There is no information available on the details of Mr. M.
    F. s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Gilan Province
    sentenced Mr. M. F. to death. The verdict was validated by the Chief
    Public Prosecutor as well as the head of the Judiciary. Mr. M. F. was
    hanged, along with three other individuals, in Rasht Central Prison on
    January 16, 2016. -------------------------------------- * H.R. , S.Q. ,
