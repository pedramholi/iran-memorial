    was hanged in Karaj Central Prison along with three other people on July
    25, 2016. News and information regarding Mr. Reza Teimuri s execution
    along with three other people was obtained through Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center s interview with one of his cellmates in Karaj s Central Prison on
    July 20, 25, and 26, 2016. The news of this execution was confirmed by an
    informed person who spoke with a staff member at Karaj s Central Prison.
    Mr. Teimuri s case pertained to drug-related offences in the city of
    Karaj. Arrest and detention Mr. Teimuri was held in the fourth dormitory
    in the Central Prison in Karaj. Several days prior to the implementation
    of the court order, Mr. Teimuri was transferred to solitary confinement in
    Karaj Central Prison. His last visit with his family took place on July
    24, 2016 (ABC interview). The circumstances of Mr. Teimuri s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Teimuri
    s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Teimuri was storing drugs
    (ABC interview). The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The evidence provided against Mr. Teimuri was approximately 3 kilograms of
    drugs (ABC interview). The report of this execution does not contain
    detailed information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Teimuri.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Teimuri s defense. Judgment Mr.
    Reza Teimuri was hanged in Karaj Central Prison along with Mr. Jamshid
    Dini , Mr. Majid Farjad Pezeshk , and Mr. Mehdi Bami on July 25, 2016.
    There is no information on the verdict leading to this execution.
