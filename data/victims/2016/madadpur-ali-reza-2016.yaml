    Alireza Madadpur, a senior student of accounting, was hired as a janitor
    to provide for his family and his education. News of Mr. Ali Reza Madadpur
    s execution was published on the Boroumand Foundation website (August 27,
    2016), and by HRANA (August 27, 2016). Additional information about this
    case was obtained from research and interviews conducted by the Boroumand
    Foundation and from HRANA s report (August 26, 2016). According to
    available information, Mr. Ali Reza Madadpur, son of Bayramali, was born
    on June 20, 1978. He was single and resided in the city of Karaj. He came
    from a poor family. His father, who was a simple laborer, had become
    unable to make a living following a work accident. Mr. Madadpur was an
    accounting student in his senior year in college and performed manual
    labor in order to pay for his educational expenses and to provide for
    himself and his family. The case against Mr. Madadpur was based on the
    discovery of illicit drugs at a house in Karaj s Fardis neighborhood where
    he had gone for the first time to perform janitorial and custodial work
    (Boroumand Foundation research). Further, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on
    the Situation of Human Rights in Iran issued an appeal to Iranian
    authorities to stop the implementation of the death sentence issued for 12
    drug-related defendants, including Mr. Madadpur (U.N. website, August 26,
    2016). Arrest and Detention Mr. Madadpur and two other individuals were
    arrested on the morning of November 12, 2011, by Police Force Drug
    Enforcement agents and Information Administration agents in the Fardis
    neighborhood, Karaj, Alborz Province. Mr. Madadpur spent a few weeks being
    interrogated at the Drug Information office in Karaj s Azimieh
    neighborhood, during which time the authorities kept his family in the
    dark about his whereabouts. Mr. Madadpur s family did not even know that
    he had been arrested. He had gone to a house for the first time to do some
    janitorial work but was arrested even before he had started the job. After
    the period of interrogation, Mr. Madadpur was transferred to Karaj Central
    Prison and was then able to inform his family of his arrest. According to
    a witness, he had lost so much weight during interrogations that he looked
    like a skeleton. Mr. Madadpur was deprived of his right to an attorney
    during interrogations and during detention. He could not afford to hire an
    attorney due to poverty. A few days prior to his trial, the court
    appointed a lawyer for him. Mr. Madadpur had become addicted to drugs
    while in college, an addiction he kicked while in prison (Boroumand
    Foundation interview with a person with knowledge of the case). Trial
    According to available information, Mr. Madadpur s trial took place on
    July 17, 2012, at Karaj Islamic Revolutionary Court Branch Four, presided
    over by Judge Farajollahi. The session, where four defendants including
    Mr. Madadpur were tried, lasted only 20 minutes. Mr. Madadpur s
    court-appointed attorney was present at the trial (Boroumand Foundation
    interview with a person with knowledge of the case). Charges The charges
    against Mr. Madadpur were possession of drugs, and possession of drug
    manufacturing paraphernalia . The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt The charges against Mr.
    Madadpur were based on the discovery of 990 grams of methamphetamine along
    with manufacturing paraphernalia at the location of the arrest, and the
    evidence against the other defendants was their confession at the
    interrogation stage. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense According to available
    information, Mr. Madadpur never accepted the charges brought against him
    and emphasized in interrogations that he had not gone to the house for
    purposes of manufacturing drugs. The residents of the house were
    themselves asleep, and no drugs were manufactured during the two hours Mr.
    Madadpur was there. All three other defendants testified in the different
    stages of adjudication, including at trial, that he had no part in
    manufacturing drugs, and confirmed Mr. Madadpur s statements. Mr. Madadpur
    had no prior criminal record and had never been arrested; no evidence
    whatsoever of any connection to the residents of the house was produced at
    trial. In addition, subsequent to the court finding him guilty, Mr.
    Madadpur s co-defendants wrote letters from inside prison confirming that
    they did not know him and that he had played no part in manufacturing the
    drugs discovered at the house (Boroumand Foundation interview with a
    person with knowledge of the case, Court Decision, Boroumand Foundation
    research). Mr. Madadpur s co-defendants testified in the court and wrote
