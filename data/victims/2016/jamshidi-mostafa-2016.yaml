    News of the execution of Mr. Mostafa Jamshidi ,along with three other
    individuals*, was announced by the website of the Human Rights Activists
    News Agency (HRANA) on January 13, 2016. The case of Mr. Jamshidi pertains
    to crimes connected to illegal drugs. The judiciary authorities and
    organizations did not post any news items regarding Mr. Jamshidi s case.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Jamshidi was transferred to solitary confinement
    on January 10, 2016. However, there is no information available on the
    details of his arrest and detention. Trial There is no information
    available on the details of the session or sessions of Mr. Jamshidi s
    trial. Charges Mr. Jamshidi was charged with crimes connected to illegal
    drugs. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences, against their opponents (including political, civil society
    activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities).
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no
    information available on the details of the evidence of guilt entered
    against Mr. Jamshidi. Defense There is no information available on the
    details of Mr. Jamshidi s defense. Judgment Mr. Mostafa Jamshidi was
    hanged, along with three other individuals, in Karaj Central Penitentiary
    Prison on Tuesday January 12, 2016. -------------------------------------
