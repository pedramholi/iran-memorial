    a police officer charged with sexual offenses , while there was no
    evidence to prove his charges. The news of Mr. Reza Sabzevari s execution
    was published by Khorasan Newspaper on July 28, 2016 and Human Rights
    Activists News Agency (HRANA) on July 27, 2016. Additional information on
    this execution was obtained through an electronic form sent by one of Mr.
    Sabzevari's acquaintances to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center on April 29,
    2018 (Electronic Form) and a comment made by an informed person on the
    news of this execution published by HRANA s website on July 31, 2016
    (Informed Person). Mr. Sabzevari was married with two children and lived
    in the city of Neyshabour, Khorasan-e Razavi province. According to HRANA,
    Mr. Sabzevari was a police officer in the anti-narcotics division.
    However, according to an informed person, Mr. Sabzevari was an
    intelligence officer (intelligence and security investigator). One of the
    acquaintances of Mr. Sabzevari, described him as a faithful, experienced,
    educated, and upstanding person (Electronic Form). Mr. Sabzevari s case
    was related to sexual offenses (Khorasan Newspaper). According to HRANA,
    Mr. Sabzevari was a police officer in the anti-narcotics division.
    However, according to an informed person, Mr. Sabzevari was an
    intelligence officer (intelligence and security investigator). Arrest and
    detention In 2015, surveillance and investigatory agencies in the city of
    Neyshabour identified Mr. Sabzevari as a suspect and arrested him
    following a series of preliminary investigations (Khorasan Newspaper).
    According to an informed person, Mr. Sabzevari was summoned to the
    Neyshabour judiciary while he was on duty on March 10, 2015. There, his
    weapon and radio were taken and he was kept in an unknown location for
    four months (Informed Person). According to an acquaintance of Mr.
    Sabzevari s, he was arrested without a warrant (Electronic Form). Mr.
    Sabzevari was held in Mashhad Prison for a year and a half before he was
    executed. Mr. Sabzevari s family s last visit was a day before the
    execution was carried out (HRANA). Trial Branch 42 of the criminal court
    in Neyshabour tried Mr. Sabzevari (Khorasan Newspaper). According to
    available information, Mr. Sabzevari s right to access a lawyer was denied
    (Electronic Form). No information is available on details of Mr. Sabzevari
    s trial. Charges According to the officials, Mr. Sabzevari was charged
    with six counts of rape, illicit relations, assault, insulting officials
    and other charges. An open-ended list of charges made the counts and
    nature of Mr. Sabzevari s charges vague and unclear. The news report
    continues that Mr. Sabzevari [abused] his authority, raped some women in
    his office and was arrested while he was [sexually] abusing a woman whose
    husband was arrested for forgery (Khorasan Newspaper). The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. The counts and
    nature of Mr. Sabzevari s charges are vague and unclear. Evidence of guilt
    According to available information, Mr. Sabzevari was convicted on the
    basis of authentic documents and evidence and the complaint filed by some
    women who had been lured [by him] (Khorasan Newspaper). De f ense
    Available information about the reasons and manner of detention,
    proceedings, trail, and charges brought against Mr. Sabzevari is
    contradictory. The Khorasan Newspaper reported that Mr. Sabzevari was
    convicted based on authentic documents and evidence. It is not clear,
    however, what is meant by authentic documents and evidence in this report.
    In the report of this execution, there are no references to the evidence
    brought against Mr. Sabzevari. An acquaintance of Mr. Sabzevari stated
    that he was sentenced to death for being honest, he was the only person
    who tried to reform things in a city full of corruption, where everyone
    supported injustice and this was the reason for his arrest (Electronic
    Form). According to an informed source s comment on HRANA s website, some
    flagrantly corrupt women were brought there [to court] by force and
    intimidated by judiciary personnel and law enforcement officers into
    signing some previously prepared documents against [Mr. Sabzevari]. There
    is no evidence of his guilt. There was no evidence to prove Mr.
    Sabzevari's charges and he was arrested and tried because of personal
    hostility of an influential person, the source claims. In addition, Mr.
    Sabzevari was not allowed to
