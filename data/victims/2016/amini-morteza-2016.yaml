    The execution of Mr. Morteza Amini was reported by the Boroumand
    Foundation (October 20, 2016). This execution, along with that of another
    person, was also reported by the Human Rights in Iran Website (October 21,
    2016). Mr. Amini was 25 years old. His case was related to illegal drugs
    crimes. Arrest and detention Mr. Amini was detained in Karaj Central
    Prison, Common Area #2. On Monday, October 17, 2016, he was transferred to
    solitary confinement. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Amini s trial. Charges
    The charge brought against Mr. Amini was transporting illegal drugs
    (Boroumand Foundation). The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The evidence provided against Mr. Amini was possession of 10 kilograms
    morphine . Defense No information is available on Mr. Amini s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Morteza Amini was sentenced to death by hanging. He was
    executed with one other person, in Karaj Central Prison, on Thursday,
    October 20, 2016.
