    did not have access to adequate medical care and treatment during the
    detention, though he could readily access illegal drugs in prison. The
    information about the execution of Mr. Jamshid Dini, son of Puran and
    Javad, along with three other people * was obtained through Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center s interview with one of his relatives on July 17, 2018
    (ABC interview) and an electronic form sent to the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center by one of his acquaintances on December 29, 2017. The news of this
    execution was confirmed by one of Mr. Dini s cellmates in Karaj s Central
    Prison. Mr. Dini was born on February 27, 1960 in Tehran. He had a high
    school diploma and ran an audio and video device store in the city of
    Gohardasht, Alborz Province. After a while, he leased his store and
    started buying and selling cars in one of his friends car dealership. Mr.
    Dini was married with two children. He was interested in sports like
    swimming and bodybuilding; however, due to heart disease, he stopped doing
    bodybuilding. His relatives remember him as a family man. Mr. Dini had a
    criminal record related to drug trafficking in 2009-10. Mr. Dini s case
    was related to drug-related offences in 2012 in the city of Karaj. Arrest
    and detention On Sunday afternoon in September 9, 2012, the agents of the
    Drug Control Headquarters in the city of Karaj arrested Mr. Dini. His
    relatives remember Mr. Dini as a family man. An individual named Mr. Majid
    Farjad Pezeshk bought a car from Mr. Dini and owed him some money. On
    September 9, 2012, Mr. Dini went to the debtor s house to request his
    money back. Mr. Farjad Pezeshk was a drug dealer, so he offered Mr. Dini
    drugs for part of the payment. Due to Mr. Dini s drug addiction, he
    accepted the offer, placed the drugs in his car, and drove toward his
    home. Since Mr. Farjad Pezeshk s house was under surveillance by agents of
    the Drug Control Headquarters, agents followed Mr. Dini s vehicle,
    arrested him before getting home, and transferred him to the Intelligence
    Headquarters in Gohardasht neighborhood in Karaj. The agents also raided
    Mr. Farjad Pezeshk s house, arrested him and transferred him to the
    Intelligence Headquarters. Mr. Farjad Pezeshk s spouse called Mr. Dini s
    family subsequently, and informed them of his arrest. Mr. Dini s family
    hired a lawyer for him, but before the verdict was issued, the lawyer was
    not allowed to meet with his client. Mr. Dini s first visit with his
    family took place about two months after his arrest, following the
    issuance of the court order. During this meeting, Mr. Dini told his family
    that he attempted to commit suicide by cutting his wrists while in
    detention at the Intelligence Headquarters in Gohardasht. After a few
    days, Mr. Dini was transferred from the Detention Center of the
    Intelligence Headquarters to the fourth dormitory in the Central Prison in
    Karaj, where he was held for four years until the implementation of his
    court order. During that time, Mr. Dini did not have access to adequate
    medical treatment, and despite suffering from lumbar disc disease, the
    judicial and prison authorities did not allow him to undergo surgery, and
    Mr. Dini had to use elbow crutches to walk. Mr. Dini did not have access
    to medicines for his heart disease, though he was able to readily access
    illegal drugs in prison. Mr. Dini s family hired a lawyer for him, but
    before the verdict was issued, the lawyer was not allowed to meet with his
    client. Two days prior to the implementation of the court order, Mr. Dini
    was transferred to solitary confinement in Karaj Central Prison. Mr. Dini
    s last visit with his family took place one day before the implementation
    of the court order. Trial On September 16, 2012, Branch 4 of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court in Karaj tried Mr. Dini and Mr. Farjad Pezeshk in one
    session. Mr. Dini s family and lawyer were not informed about the court
    session until the court date. One of Mr. Dini s cellmates called his
    family from prison and informed Mr. Dini s spouse that he had been taken
    to the court for trial. Mr. Dini s spouse then contacted the lawyer
    immediately. Despite the fact that Mr. Dini s spouse and lawyer were
    present at court, they were not allowed to attend the trial, and Mr. Dini
    s attorney was only able to file his defense statement. The trial session
    for both defendants in this case lasted less than 15 minutes. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Dini was carrying and storing drugs. Evidence
    of guilt The evidence provided against Mr. Dini was 295 grams of
    methamphetamine discovered in his vehicle. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Dini s defense. According to available information, Mr.
    Dini had a heart attack before the execution, and the enforcement officers
    took his dead body to the gallows for hanging. Judgment In
    October/November 2012, Branch 4 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in
    Karaj sentenced Mr. Dini to two years in prison and execution. About two
    months later, the Supreme Court upheld the verdict. Mr. Jamshid
