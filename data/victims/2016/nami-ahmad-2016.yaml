    The execution of Mr. Ahmad Nami, and three other people*, on April 19,
    2016, was reported by HRANA News Service. Mr. Ahmad Nami was from the
    village of Balulan, Orumieh. His case has to do with illegal drugs. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of Mr. Nami s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Nami s trial. Charges
    According to available information, the charge brought against Mr. Nami
    has to do with approximately 850-900 grams heroin . However, there is no
    information on the details of his charges. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress . Defense No information is available on Mr. Nami s defense.
    Judgment The court sentenced Mr. Ahmad Nami to death by hanging. Mr. Nami
    and three other defendants were executed on Tuesday April 19, 2016, in
    Orumieh Prison. ------------------------ *Messers: Manuchehr Razani,
