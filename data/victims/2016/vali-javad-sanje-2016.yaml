    . The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair

    reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands
    of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following
    judicial processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of
    them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences
    on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
