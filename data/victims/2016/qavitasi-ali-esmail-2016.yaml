    Kamal Karimi, member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party s political office
    February 5, 2021; December 22, 2021), with a person with knowledge of the

    Western Azarbaijan Province. He had gone to school up to eighth grade
    (Boroumand Center Interview, March 10, 2021). In 1985, Mr. Qavitasi
    contacted the inner organization of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of
    Iran, and he joined this party as a Peshmerga in 1987. Starting in 1987,
    Mr. Qavitasi was a Peshmerga in the Advance Forces of the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party of Iran for four years. From 1991 to 1997, he served in
    different capacities in the Advance Forces. From 1997 to 2000, Mr.
    Qavitasi served as a member of the Central Committee for the town of
    Mahabad, and in 1998, he was a committee member of the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party of Iran in Mahabad for a year. From 2000 to 2001, he was

    Instruction for the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran. From 2002 to 2003,
    he was the political and military instructor for the Kurdistan Democratic
    Party of Iran. From 2004 to 2006, Mr. Qavitasi served on the teaching and

    He served as the head of the Educational Center in the Education

    Democratic Party Archives) According to a close acquaintance, Mr. Esma il
    Qavitasi was knowledgeable, experienced, modest, humble, a capable
    manager, and respected by all. He was opposed to fracturing in the
    Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran and he believed Kurds would achieve
    their goals through collaboration and unity (Boroumand Center Interview,
    March 10, 2021). The Kurdish Problem in the Islamic Republic After the
    1979 Islamic Revolution, the disagreements between the government of the
    Shiite Islamic Republic and the organizations in the Kurdish regions of
    western Iran regarding the rights and roles of minorities in drafting the
    Constitution; whether the government should be secular or religious, and
    especially the issue of Kurdish autonomy; and conflicts that resulted in
    Kurdish political organizations boycotting the April 1979 Referendum on
    instituting an Islamic Republic; led to serious, and at times armed,
    clashes between the central government and the Peshmerga (Kurdistan
    Democratic Party s armed forces). On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini
    labeled the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), the oldest and
    most influential Kurdish Party, the Party of the Devil , and declared it
    unofficial and illegal , and ordered a military attack on Kurdistan. Mass
    executions and intense armed clashes continued in the region for months,
    clashes that resulted in the deaths of a number of civilians and the
    displacement and relocation of the residents of certain towns. In the next
    four years, Kurdish parties lost their grip on power in the region to a
    great extent, and relocated to Iraqi Kurdistan. Since then, a number of
    their leaders and members have been assassinated outside Iran, especially
    in Iraqi Kurdistan. In the years since the Islamic Republic has been in
    existence, in addition to such entities as the Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan, Komala (Revolutionary Organization of the Toilers of Iranian
    Kurdistan), the Koran School led by Ahmad Moftizadeh, Organization of
    Iranian Kurdistan Struggle (which was active in the early years of the
    Revolution), certain other Kurdish opposition parties were established
    outside Iran, such as the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK) and the
    Kurdistan Freedom Party (PAK). These parties, with policies and ideologies
    that are not necessarily similar and uniform, have settled in parts of the
    Kurdistan Autonomous Region in Iraq, such as Koy, Soleimanieh, and in the
    foothills of Qandil mountains. Some of these parties have undergone splits
    in recent years. These conflicts have been more a
