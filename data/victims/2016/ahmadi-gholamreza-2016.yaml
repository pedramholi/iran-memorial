    Mr. Ahmadi was kept in solitary confinement starting four days before his
    execution. Information regarding Mr. Gholamreza Ahmadi s execution was
    obtained from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center
    with a person with knowledge of the case (May 24, 2016). News of this
    execution was also published by HRANA, the news arm of the Human Rights
    Activists in Iran (May 24, 2016), without mentioning him by name. Mr.
    Ahmadi was 36 years old. (Boroumand Center interview, May 24, 2016).
    Arrest and detention Mr. Ahmadi was incarcerated at the [city of] Karaj
    Central Prison s Ward 4. (Boroumand Center interview, May 24, 2016). He
    was transferred to the solitary confinement ward of Qezelhessar Prison on
    May 21, 2016. Mr. Ahamadi visited with his family at this prison for the
    last time. (HRANA, May 24, 2016). No further information is available
    regarding the details of Mr. Ahmadi s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Ahmadi s trial. Charges The charge against
    Mr. Ahmadi was announced to have been related to narcotic drugs . The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of prescribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Mr. Ahmadi. A person with knowledge of the case told the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center that Mr. Ahmadi s case was related to 6
    kilograms (approximately 13 pounds) of narcotic drugs. (Boroumand Center
    interview, May 24, 2016). Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Ahmadi s defense. Judgment After waiting for four days in a solitary
    confinement cell for the implementation of his sentence, Mr. Gholamreza
    Ahmadi, along with three others*, was executed in the morning of May 24,
    2016, at Karaj s Qezelhessar Prison. Mr. Ahmadi s body was buried at Karaj
    s Behesht-e Sakineh Cemetery. (Boroumand Center interview, May 24, 2016).
