    The execution of Mr. Khaled Johari was reported by Iran Human Rights
    Organization, on December 28, 2016. Mr. Khaled Johari, son of Namegh, was
    born in DivanDarreh, in Kordestan Province. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Johari was arrested in an illegal drugs lab, four kilometers outside of
    Bandar Abbas on November 5, 2011. The details of his arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial Mr. Johari was tried by the Revolutionary Court of
    Bandar Abbas on August 14, 2012 (Iran Human Rights Organization, December
    28, 2016). No further information is available on his trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Khaled Johari was transportation and possession
    of 1.850 kilograms crystal meth and approximately 500 grams crack cocaine
    (Iran Human Rights Organization, December 28, 2016). The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Johari s defense. Judgment Mr. Khaled
    Johari was sentenced to death by hanging on August 14, 2012. The execution
    of Mr. Johari was carried out on December 27, 2016, in Bandar Abbas
    Prison.
