    The execution of Mr. Mostafa Ejmali (in the News they say Ejlali) on April
    13, 2016 was reported by HRANA News Service. His last name was confirmed
    to be Ejmali , according to Boroumand Foundation research. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Ejmali s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on this defendant s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Ejmali was murder . The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Ejmali s defense.
    Judgment The court sentenced Mr. Mostafa Ejmali to death. Mr. Ejmali was
    executed on the morning of Wednesday April 13, 2016, at Raja i Shahr
    Prison, in Karaj. The day before this sentence was carried out, the
    officials at Raja i Shahr Prison transferred Mr. Ejmali, together with
    more than seven other people, to solitary confinement.
