    According to Mr. Salehi, not only had he not distributed any CD s or
    declarations, he was opposed to such actions, but he was arrested simply
    because he knew about it News of Mr. Amjad Salehi and 24 other individuals
    execution was published by various sources including IRNA (August 3,
    2016), IRIB News Agency (August 3, 2016), Fars News Agency (August 2,
    2016), Khorassan Newspaper (August 4, 2016), HRANA (August 3, 2016),
    Kurdistan Human Rights Defenders Center (August 3, 2016), and the Amnesty
    International Report (November 17, 2016). Additional information about
    this execution was obtained through a Boroumand Foundation interview with
    a person close to Mr. Salehi, from an Information Ministry Announcement
    (Islamic Republic of Iran Information Ministry website, August 3, 2016),
    Kurdistan Province Judiciary Announcement (Fars New Agency, August 2,
    2016), and from other sources.* Mr. Amjad Salehi, child of Fa egh, was a
    Sunni Kurd from [the city of] Sanandaj. He was married, lived in Kani
    Kuzleh neighborhood, and owned a supermarket. He was an architecture
    student at Kurdistan University but dropped out in 2009 because he was
    arrested. According to a person who knew him, Mr. Salehi was a religious
    man, a follower of the Shafe i** branch of Islam, and knew the Koran by
    heart. He had participated in religious and faith-based classes of the
    adherents of the Sunni faith in Sanandaj prior to his arrest, and
    continued studying and learning the subject matters of the Sunni faith in
    prison. He was not affiliated with any particular group or organization
    and had moderate religious views. He was a quiet man who helped the poor
    out financially. According to a person close to Mr. Salehi, he had an
    arrest record: In 2009, he had been arrested in Sanandaj s Azadi Square by
    Sanandaj Information Administration forces. He was released on bail after
    spending a few months in the Sanandaj Information Administration detention
    center. Sunni defendants families correspondence, including Mr. Salehi s,
    with the Leader, the Head of the Judiciary, and the President, as well as
    sit-ins and follow-ups with the authorities in protesting the arrest and
    issuance of a death sentence, bore no fruit. (Boroumand Foundation
    interview). According to the Amnesty International report, security forces
    threatened Mr. Salehi s family and lawyers in order to prevent them from
    releasing information about the cases and to stop them from giving
    interviews to media and human rights organizations. Background Based on
    available information, in the years 2007 to 2009-10, Shi a evangelists
    hurled numerous insults at Sunni beliefs and Sunni respected figures, with
    severe backlash from Sunni religious figures and activists. Following
    famous Shi a movie director Ebrahim Hatamikia s offensive statements about
    Aisha, the Prophet s wife, in Khanevadeye Sabz ( Green Family ) Magazine
    (Volume 195, 2007-08), and statements made by several well-known preachers
    such as Hojjatoleslams Daneshmand, Juybari, and Ansari whose speeches were
    covered by [IRIB,] state radio and television in certain instances a
    number of religious Sunni youth from Kurdistan (who considered these
    insults as being organized) proceeded to hold classes, distribute books
    and CD s in local mosques, universities, and their neighborhoods,
    protesting against these actions and raising awareness, as well as
    promoting and defending the tenets of the Shafe i religion.** These CD s
    contained documented instances of offensive language used against Sunni
    beliefs, quoted from well-known religious sources of the Shi a religion
    such as Bohar-ol-Anvar. The religious activities of these young people
    raised the security apparatus sensitivity. Subsequent to Ayatollah
    Khamenei s trip to Sanandaj in April-May 2009, several young Sunni Kurd
    religious activists were arrested in the name of fighting Salafi and
    Takfiri (term used to denote Sunni extremists such as al-Qaeda and ISIS)
    movements. Three months later, a number of assassinations were carried out
    in Sanandaj, including Mamusta Sheikh-ol-Eslam, member of the Assembly of
    Experts, and Molla Borhan Aali, a Sunni cleric. Security forces accused
    certain individuals of murder, who had been arrested after these
    assassinations. The arrestees denied any connection to armed, extremist,
    or radical groups, objected to the charges brought against them, and asked
    for a new and public trial, to no avail. Ultimately, six of the arrestees
    were executed in December 2012-January 2013, and six others on March 4,
    2015. Also, continuing this process, 25 others, named the Unity and Jihad
    Group , were put to death on August 2, 2016. The issuance and
    implementation of the death penalty for this group of Sunni adherents, was
    followed by the reaction of numerous domestic and international
    individuals and organizations. On June 12, 2014, eighteen human rights
    organizations, including the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation and a human
    rights lawyer, protested the sentences in a declaration and de
