    Mr. Sediq Abdollah Ali was not affiliated with any political party. He was
    killed because he was accompanying a PJAK member on that day. Information
    regarding the extrajudicial execution of Mr. Sediq Abdollah Ali, also
    known as Sediq Saliyava'i, son of Khanum and Abdollah, was obtained from
    an interview with an informed person (October 27, 2022), an interview with
    a close acquaintance of Kamal Qader Sadeq, the other victim who was killed
    with him (April 20, 2021), and relevant judicial documents, including the
    verdict issued by the Second Criminal Court of Sulaymaniyah in Kurdistan,
    Iraq (August 14, 2017) and the decision of the Kurdistan Region's Court of
    Appeals (June 24, 2018). It has also been mentioned in other sources such
    as the Free Life Party of Kurdistan (PJAK*) (April 15, 2016), NNS Roj News
    (August 14, 2017), Firat News Agency (April 13, 2019), and the Kurdistan
    Human Rights Association (April 13, 2019). Mr. Sediq Abdollah Ali, a
    48-year-old Kurdish man from Penjwin in the Sulaymaniyah province of Iraqi
    Kurdistan, was married with five children and had basic education. He was
    a retired forest ranger from Penjwin and worked in construction.
    (Interview with the Boroumand Center, October 27, 2022) An informed
    acquaintance has confirmed that Mr. Sediq Abdollah Ali was not affiliated
    with any political party and was known as a "social and popular" person.
    He was dedicated to resolving issues and "mediating between people.
    (Interview with the Boroumand Center, October 27, 2022) Background of
    Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic
    Republic of Iran has a long history of politically motivated violence in
    Iran and around the world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic
    operatives inside and outside the country have engaged in kidnapping,
    disappearing, and killing a large number of individuals whose activities
    they deemed undesirable. The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial
    killings inside Iran is not clear; however, these murders began in
    February 1979 and have continued since then, both inside and outside Iran.
    The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far identified over 540 killings
    outside Iran attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Dissidents have
    been assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic outside Iran in
    countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan
    in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East; Cyprus, France,
    Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in
    Europe; and the United States across the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases,
    there has not been much published, and local authorities have not issued
    arrest warrants. But documentation, evidence, and traces obtained through
    investigations conducted by local police and judicial authorities confirm
    the theory of state committed crimes. In some instances, these
    investigations have resulted in the expulsion or arrest of Iranian
    diplomats. In a few cases outside Iran, the perpetrators of these murders
    have been arrested and put on trial. The evidence presented revealed the
    defendants connection to Iran s government institutions, and an arrest
    warrant has been issued for Iran s Minister of Information. The manner in
    which these killings were organized and implemented in Iran and abroad is
    indicative of a single pattern which, according to Roland Chatelin, the
    Swiss prosecutor, contains common parameters and detailed planning. It can
    be ascertained from the similarities between these murders in different
    countries that the Iranian government is the principal entity that ordered
    the implementation of these crimes. Iranian authorities have not
    officially accepted responsibility for these murders and have even
    attributed their commission to internal strife in opposition groups.
    Nevertheless, since the very inception of the Islamic Republic regime, the
    Islamic Republic officials have justified these crimes from an ideological
    and legal standpoint. In the spring of 1979, Sadeq Khalkhali, the first
    Chief Shari a Judge of the Islamic Revolutionary Courts, officially
    announced the regime s decision to implement extrajudicial executions and
    justified the decision: These people have been sentenced to death; from
    the Iranian people s perspective, if someone wants to assassinate these
    individuals abroad, in any country, no government has any right to bring
    the perpetrator to trial as a terrorist, because such a person is the
    implementing agent of the sentence issued by the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court. Therefore, they are Mahduroddam and their sentence is death
    regardless of where they are. More than 10 years after these
    proclamations, in a speech about the security forces success, Ali
    Fallahian, the regime s Minister of Information, stated the following
    regarding the elimination of members of the opposition: We have had
    success in inflicting damage to many of these little groups outside the
    country and on our borders. At the same time, various politic
