    Information on the killing of Mr. Sangar Sattar Khezr, son of Sattar and
    Sinam, was taken from an Abdorrahman Boroumand Center interview with the
    brother of Mr. Sangar Sattar Khezr (March 9, 2021). News of this killing
    was also published on the official website of the Kurdistan Democratic
    Party, Kurdistan u Kurd (December 22, 2016), and on the Raja News website
    (December 21, 2016). Additional information about this case was obtained
    through interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with Mr.
    Kamal Karimi, member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party s political office
    February 5, 2021; December 22, 2021), with a person with knowledge of the
    case (February 19, 2021), the Kurdistan Democratic Party s By-Laws
    ratified during the Party s 16 th Congress (January - February 2016), and
    other sources.* Mr. Sangar Sattar Khezr was Kurdish and he was Sunni. He
    was born in 1987 in Erbil in Iraq s Kurdistan State. He had a college
    degree in Kurdish Literature and he lived in Koya in Iraqi Kurdistan. Mr.
    Sattar Khezr was a member of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. In
    September 2016 he was employed as a police officer in Koya and he worked
    at the checkpoint on the road to the headquarters of the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party, which was under the jurisdiction of the government of
    Iraqi Kurdistan (Boroumand Center Interview, March 9, 2021). According to
    Mr. Sattar Khezr s brother, he was very polite, calm, sociable, and he was
    very popular (Boroumand Center Interview, March 9, 2021). The Kurdish
    Problem in the Islamic Republic After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the
    disagreements between the government of the Shiite Islamic Republic and
    the organizations in the Kurdish regions of western Iran regarding the
    rights and roles of minorities in drafting the Constitution; whether the
    government should be secular or religious, and especially the issue of
    Kurdish autonomy; and conflicts that resulted in Kurdish political
    organizations boycotting the April 1979 Referendum on instituting an
    Islamic Republic; led to serious, and at times armed, clashes between the
    central government and the Peshmerga (Kurdistan Democratic Party s armed
    forces). On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini labeled the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), the oldest and most influential Kurdish
    Party, the Party of the Devil , and declared it unofficial and illegal ,
    and ordered a military attack on Kurdistan. Mass executions and intense
    armed clashes continued in the region for months, clashes that resulted in
    the deaths of a number of civilians and the displacement and relocation of
    the residents of certain towns. In the next four years, Kurdish parties
    lost their grip on power in the region to a great extent, and relocated to
    Iraqi Kurdistan. Since then, a number of their leaders and members have
    been assassinated outside Iran, especially in Iraqi Kurdistan. In the
    years since the Islamic Republic has been in existence, in addition to
    such entities as the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, Komala
    (Revolutionary Organization of the Toilers of Iranian Kurdistan), the
    Koran School led by Ahmad Moftizadeh, Organization of Iranian Kurdistan
    Struggle (which was active in the early years of the Revolution), certain
    other Kurdish opposition parties were established outside Iran, such as
    the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK) and the Kurdistan Freedom Party
    (PAK). These parties, with policies and ideologies that are not
    necessarily similar and uniform, have settled in parts of the Kurdistan
    Autonomous Region in Iraq, such as Koy, Soleimanieh, and in the foothills
    of Qandil mountains. Some of these parties have undergone splits in recent
    years. These conflicts have been more about the methods of running the
    organizations rather than theoretical and ideological differences. These
    parties have not controlled any part of the Iranian territory since the
    late 1980 s, and have adopted different strategies in different periods in
    order to confront the Islamic Republic, advance their political
    objectives, and recruit members. Beginning in 2006, the conflicts between
    the regime and Kurdish parties who had increased their presence in Iran in
    reaction to the government intensifying the detention and execution of
    Kurdish activists and the spread of fundamentalist beliefs in Kurdish
    regions entered a new and more serious phase. Kurdish forces, especially
    the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan and the PJAK, were attacked
    several times inside Iran and in Iraqi Kurdistan border regions by border
    patrol forces and the revolutionary Guards. That same year, Revolutionary
    Guards conducted armed attacks against the positions of Iranian Kurdish
    parties inside the borders of the Kurdish Autonomous Region in Iraq. The
    bombing of the Night of Yalda ceremonies (an ancient celebration of the
    longest night of the year) in 2006, which was also Abdorrahman Qassemlu s
    birthday, resulted in the death of five Party members and 2 members of the
    Iraqi Kurdistan security forces.
