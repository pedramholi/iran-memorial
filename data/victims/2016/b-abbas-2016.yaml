    The execution of Mr. Abbas B. was reported by the Public Relations Office
    of the Mazandaran Province Ministry of Justice Website (January 4, 2016)
    and the Security Forces News Site (January 4, 2016). Additional
    information was gathered from the following websites: Fars News Service
    (August 5, 2015), Journalists Association (July 29 and May 5, 2015),
    Varash News (June 25, 2015), Iran Newspaper (June 11, May 17, and May 21,
    2015), Tabari News (May 14, 2015), Myanjir (May 14, 2015) and Baran e
    Shomal (May 7, 2015). Mr. Abbas B. was 38, married, and lived in the town
    of Myandorood. He was employed by one of the pseudo-governmental offices
    in Mazandaran Province. His case has to do with the murder of a young
    woman in Myandorood, Mazandaran Province. On April 29, 2015, a young woman
    in the village of Darab Kola, in the neighborhood of Myandorood, got into
    a black Pride taxi, in order to go to the dentist in Sari. After several
    days of not knowing what had happened to her, the people of the village
    gathered in front of the local Neka constabulary, and demanded the
    officials look into her disappearance (Young Journalists Association, May
    5, 2015, Baran e Shomal, May 7, 2015). Mr. Abbas B. was the driver of the
    Pride that had picked up the young woman. Arrest and detention There have
    been conflicting reports published about the circumstances of Mr. Abbas B.
    s arrest. According to the first report that was published in a local
    paper, two weeks after a young woman had disappeared, Mr. Abbas B.
    surrendered to the police. He said that he and a friend had picked up the
    woman as a passenger. They had stolen her jewelry, murdered her, and
    abandoned her body in the woods near one of the villages of Jareeb Neka
    (Tabari News, May 14, 2015). Trial Branch 2 of the Criminal Court of
    Mazandaran Province I, tried Mr. Abbas B. in three sessions. The first
    session met at 10 am, on June 9, 2015. There were five judges, the family
    of the victim and their lawyer, Mr. Abbas B. with his court-appointed
    counsel, and the other defendant with his court-appointed lawyer in
    attendance. The court was in session until 2:30 pm (Iran Newspaper, June
    11, 2015). The second session was convened on Thursday, June 25, 2015. Mr.
    Abbas B. and his appointed lawyer, the second defendant and his appointed
    lawyer, the family of the victim and their lawyer, and three judges were
    in session from 10 am until the end of the day. In this session, the
    Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Neka indicted the defendants and
    asked for them to be sentenced. The parents and the husband of the victim
    also asked for the defendants to be punished. According to published
    accounts, Mr. Abbas B. stated in court that he had personally inflicted
    knife and ax blows on the victim (Varash News, June 25, 2015). According
    to available information, considering the fact that the body had been
    nearly destroyed by wild animals, the court ordered the Medical Examiner
    to perform DNA tests on the remains (Varash News, June 25, 2015). The
    third court session met on July 29, 2015, from 10 am until 1 pm. In this
    session, the judge announced that according to DNA testing of the remains,
    the bones were those of the victim. The prosecutor requested the maximum
    sentence, and the family of the victim requested the defendants to be hung
    in public, at the site of the crime, as retribution. The judge heard the
    defense statements and announced that the panel of judges would announce
    the verdict after a week (Young Journalists Club, July 29, 2015). Charges
    According to available information, the charge brought against Mr. Abbas
    B. was accomplice to murder in the first degree, kidnapping, and
    aggravated robbery . Evidence of guilt According to available information,
    the remains that were discovered and identified as the victim by DNA
    testing, along with her clothes and shoes, were entered as evidence in
    this case. The discovery of gold and other jewelry, belonging to the
    victim, that had been sold to a third defendant, was also entered as
    evidence. The confessions of Mr. Abbas B. and his co-defendants, during
    the police investigation and also in court, provided additional items of
    evidence in his case (Varash News, June 25, 2015, and Young Journalists
    Club, May 5, 2015). Defense According to available information, Mr. Abbas
    B. stated in court that he and the second defendant intended to commit
    robbery. That was why they picked up the victim. He said, We thought she
    was well to do. After a while, my friend got into the back seat and
    threatened her with a knife, to keep her quiet. The young woman tried to
    jump out of the car. At that point, my friend stabbed her with the knife a
    few times, and pushed her head under the seat. Mr. Abbas B. said that the
    victim had seen his face, so they proceeded towards the woods around Neka.
    After they took her valuables, afraid of being identified, they dumped her
    half-dead body in a valley in the Ghormaraz Woods and fled the scene.
    After a while, they worried that she
