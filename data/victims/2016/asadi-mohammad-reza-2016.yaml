    News and information about the execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Asadi was
    obtained from an Abdorrahman Boroumand Center interview with two informed
    sources, on July 21, 2016. News of this execution was also published in
    Iran Newspaper on July 21, 2016. Additional information was gleaned from
    the court s verdict, recorded in Boroumand Center archives. According to
    an informed source, at the time of his arrest, Mr. Asadi was single. There
    is no further information about Mr. Asadi s circumstances (ABC Interview,
    July 21, 2016). Mr. Asadi s case had to do with illegal drug offences.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances and exact details of Mr. Asadi s
    arrest and detention are not known. The public revolutionary prosecutor of
    Karaj, Reza Shakarmai, gave an interview to Iran Newspaper. In this
    interview he explained how four individuals, including Mr. Asadi, were
    arrested in an underground workshop during a strike operation, after being
    identified by drug enforcement officers of Alborz Province (Iran
    Newspaper, July 21, 2016). Mr. Asadi was incarcerated in Hall No.4 of
    Karaj Penitentiary. Trial No information has been published on Mr. Asadi s
    trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Asadi was possession of
    1,100 grams of a narcotic substance, specifically crystal meth (ABC
    Interview, July 21, 2016; Iran Newspaper, July 21, 2016). The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the Karaj Prosecutor, during the
    raid on the workshop where Mr. Asadi and three other people were
    apprehended, one kilogram crystal meth was found and impounded. During
    further investigation, it was determined that these individuals had
    several criminal records, including narcotics smuggling . The prosecutor
    did not give any details about these criminal records or about Mr. Asadi s
    personal record (Iran Newspaper, July 21, 2016). Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Asadi s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Karaj sentenced Mr. Asadi to death by hanging, in connection with the
    discovery and impounding of 1,100 gram narcotics, specifically crystal
    meth . This verdict was approved by the Supreme Court. Mr. Asadi s death
    sentence was carried out on July 19, 2016, in the Central Karaj
    Penitentiary courtyard (Center Interview, July 20 and 21, 2016; Iran
    Newspaper, July 21, 2016). Mr. Asadi was able to meet with his family the
    day before his sentence was carried out (Center Interview, July 20 and 21,
    2016)
