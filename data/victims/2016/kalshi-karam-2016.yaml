    News of the execution of Mr. Karam Kalshi along with seven* other
    individuals was announced by the websites of Human Rights Activists News
    Agency (HRANA) and Center of Democracy and Human Rights in Kurdistan
    (Mafnews) on September 29, 2016. Additional information on this case was
    obtained from the websites of Iran Human Rights (September 29, 2016) and
    Kurdpa News Agency (February 4, 2013). Mr. Kalshi, 48, was a Kurd who used
    to live in the Sepah Town of Orumieh (Kurdpa, February 4, 2013). He was

    Trial A court in Orumieh sentenced Mr. Kalshi to death in 2013 (Kurdpa,
    February 4, 2013). However, there is no information available on the

    charged with purchase and sale of narcotics (Kurdpa, February 4, 2013).
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information available on
    the details of the evidence of guilt entered against Mr. Kalshi. Defense
    According to an informed source, a person who was allegedly an agent of
    the Ministry of Intelligence placed a package in the care of Mr. Kalshi.
    The package contained six kilograms of narcotics. According to a person
    who knew Mr. Kalshi, he was not aware of the contents of the package
    (Kurdpa, February 4, 2013). There is no information available on the
    details of Mr. Kalshi s defense. Judgment Mr. Karam Kalshi was hanged
    along with seven other individuals in Orumieh Central Prison (Darya) on
