    The execution of Mr. Ali Akbar Karami was reported by HRANA Website, the
    Human Rights Activists News Agency (December 6, 2016), and the Iran Human
    Rights Website (December 7, 2016). Mr. Karami was from the town of
    Kangavar in Kermanshah Province. His case was related to a murder that
    happened in 2013, in the area of Kangavar Asad Abad, in Kermanshah
    Province. Arrest and detention Mr. Karami became a fugitive after the
    incident of murder. He turned himself in to the officials two months
    later. He spent more than two years in prison. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Karami s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr.
    Karami was murder . During a family dispute, he killed his cousin (his
    father s brother s son). The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Karami s defense. Judgment Mr. Ali Akbar Karami was
    sentenced to death by hanging. He was executed on Tuesday, December 6,
    2016, in Dizel Abad Prison, in Kermanshah.
