    News of the execution of Mr. Farhad Maleki along with seven* other
    individuals was announced by the websites of Human Rights Activists News
    Agency (HRANA) and Center of Democracy and Human Rights in Kurdistan
    (Mafnews) on September 29, 2016. Additional information on this case was
    obtained from the website of Iran Human Rights (September 29, 2016). Mr.

    Maleki was charged with crimes connected to narcotics. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information available on
    the details of the evidence of guilt entered against Mr. Maleki. Defense
    There is no information available on the details of Mr. Maleki s defense.

    available on the details of this execution. ---------------------------- *
