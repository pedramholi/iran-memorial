    News of execution of Mr. Behnam Pirkuzadegan along with seven* other
    individuals was announced by the websites of Human Rights Activists News
    Agency (HRANA) and Center of Democracy and Human Rights in Kurdistan
    (Mafnews) on September 29, 2016. Additional information on this case was
    obtained from the website of the Organization of Kurdistan s Women
    (November 2, 2016) and Kurdistan Human Rights KHRN (October 1, 2016). Mr.
    Pirkuzadegan was a Kurd from Kermanshah (Mafnews, September 29, 2016). His
    case pertains to crimes connected to narcotics. Arrest and detention There
    is no information available on the details of Mr. Pirkuzadegan s arrest
    and detention. Trial There is no information available on the details of
    the session or sessions of Mr. Pirkuzadegan s trial. Charges Mr.
    Pirkuzadegan was charged with purchase and sale of narcotics (Organization
    of Kurdistan s Women, November 2, 2016). The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information available on
    the details of the evidence of guilt entered against Mr. Pirkuzadegan.
    Defense There is no information available on the details of Mr.
    Pirkuzadegan s defense. Judgment Mr. Behnam Pirkuzadegan was hanged along
    with seven other individuals in Orumieh Central Prison (Darya) on the
    morning of September 29, 2016 (HRANA and Mafnews, September 29, 2016).
    There is no further information available on the details of this
    execution. ----------------------- * Ms. Moluk Nuri , Messrs. Esma'il
