    News of the execution of Mr. Kret (Reza) Ebdalzadeh along with seven*
    other individuals was announced by the websites of Human Rights Activists
    News Agency (HRANA) and Center of Democracy and Human Rights in Kurdistan
    (Mafnews) on September 29, 2016. Additional information on this case was
    obtained from Aso News (October 22, 2016) and Wikipedia (July 22, 2017).
    Mr. Ebdalzadeh was from the village of Barderash in Kurdistan Province
    (Aso News, October 22, 2016), and his case pertains to crimes connected to
    narcotics. Arrest and detention There is no information available on the
    details of Mr. Ebdalzadeh s arrest and detention. Trial There is no
    information available on the details of the session or sessions of Mr.
    Ebdalzadeh s trial. Charges Mr. Ebdalzadeh was charged with crimes
    connected to narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    There is no information available on the details of the evidence of guilt
    entered against Mr. Ebdalzadeh. Defense There is no information available
    on the details of Mr. Ebdalzadeh s defense. Judgment Mr. Kret (Reza)
    Ebdalzadeh was hanged along with seven other individuals in Orumieh
    Central Prison (Darya) on the morning of September 29, 2016 (HRANA and
    Mafnews, September 29, 2016). Mr. Ebdalzadeh s funeral services were held
    in the Tarzilou Village of Orumieh County in West Azarbaijan Province.
    There is no further information available on the details of this
    execution. ------------------------------- * Ms. Moluk Nuri , Messrs.
