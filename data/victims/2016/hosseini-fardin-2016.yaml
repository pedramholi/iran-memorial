    Mr. Fardin Hosseini was a follower of the Ahl-e Haq creed, the Nurali
    School, had a high school diploma, and was in business for himself. He did
    not have a criminal record, and always tried to be a law abiding citizen
    News of Mr. Fardin Hosseini s execution was published by Fars New Agency
    (January 24, 2016) and Mashreq Website (January 24, 2016). Additional
    information about this case was obtained through Boroumand Foundation
    research and interviews, materials published by the Human Rights Activists
    for Democracy in Iran website (September 14, 2014, June 6, August 3 and 7,
    2015), Ahl-e Haq website (February 10, 2008), and Jam-e Jam Newspaper
    website (June 20 and 21, 2007) Mr. Fardin Hosseini, child of Sahebeddin,
    was from [the town of] Sahneh in Kermanshah Province, resided in [the town
    of] Hashtgerd in Alborz Province, was married, and had a 14-year-old
    daughter. He had stated that he was a follower of the Ahl-e Haq creed, the
    Nurali Elahi School a branch of Shi a Islam had a high school diploma, and
    was in business for himself. He had no criminal record. He tried to live
    life as a law abiding citizen, [to have respect for] his own rights and to
    respect the rights of others, and behave in conformity with legal and
    social [norms and] exigencies. (Mr. Hosseini s handwritten notes and
    Boroumand Foundation research). Ahl-e Haq or Yarsan is a creed with
    mystical rites that, based on the book Nameh Saranjam ( The Discourse of
    Conclusion ), originated in Ahd-e Alast ( Time without Beginning ). In the
    9thcentury AD, the secrets of this religion reached Bohlul Mahi who was
    born in a Kurdish family, and had studied with Jafar Sadeq, the sixth Shi
    a Imam, in his youth. His resting place on top of Tangeh Gul mountain in
    Iran s [town of] Eslamabad-e Gharb is a shrine where his followers visit
    as pilgrimage. In the following centuries, Baba Sarhang, Shah Khoshin, and
    Baba Na us continued his way in Iran s western regions. Yarsan had
    disappeared from the 12thcentury A.D. until the 14thcentury A.D., when
    Soltan Sahak revived the creed in Sahneh, Kermanshah, and started to
    promote it in the regions of Uraman, Javanrud, Goran, and the Dalaho
    mountains. Sultan Sahak is considered the legislator of Ahl-e Haq. The
    Ahl-e Haq creed is based on deep spiritual and religious emotions, and Ali
    bin Abi-Taleb, the first Shi a Imam, occupies a special place in it. Ahl-e
    Haq is not solely an Islamic school of thought: It contains a collection
    of Zoroastrian, Manichaeist, Christian, and Jewish beliefs. Ahl-e Haq
    believe in reincarnation [or transmigration of the soul ] (in the form of
    re-birth or continuation of the spirit after death in another body) and
    Ittihad (the manifestation of the Divine Essence in a human body or in a
    place), and do not believe in Ma ad (Heaven and Hell). Paki ( Purity
    [internally as well as externally]), Rasti ( Truth [abstinence from
    falsehood and sin]), Nisti ( Inexistence [suppressing and destroying all
    desires to reach a level of Godliness]), and Reda ( Magnanimity
    [self-sacrifice and being of service to others]) are the four pillars of
    Ahl-e Haq. Based on available information, Ahl-e Haq has 11 families, one
    of which is Ahl-e Haq Shah Hayasi . Nurali Elahi was the leader of the
    latter family, known as Daravish, from 1959 to 1974. He founded a school
    of thought that later came to be known as the Nurali Elahi School. His
    continuing lectures at Ahl-e Haq gatherings over the course of 10 years,
    from 1964 to 1974, were later published in the form of a book entitled
    Borhan al-Haq ( Demonstration of the Truth ). Nurali Elahi passed away in
    1974 and his mummified body was buried in Hashtgerd. His tomb was
    destroyed 10 years later by the order of Hashtgerd s then-Friday Prayer
    Imam. The Islamic Republic considers the Nurali Elahi School misleading
    and perversive ; it is also considered to be a breakaway school among the
    Ahl-e Haq as well. Sahneh in Kermanshah Province, Hamedan, Hashtgerd in
    Alborz Province, Kelardasht in Mazandaran Province, and Garmsar in Semnan
    Province, are among regions where Nurali Elahi s followers reside.
    According to the book Borhan al-Haq , Ahl-e Haq are Moslem, adhere to the
    tenets of the Koran, and perform all their religious duties in accordance
    with the dictates of God s Holy Scripture. (Boroumand Foundation
    research). Mr. Hosseini s case is related to the assassination of
    Hashtgerd s Friday Prayer Imam in Alborz Province, and to an individual s
    murder in Kermanshah Province. Hashtgerd s Friday Prayer Imam was killed
    in 2007-08 by unidentified persons. According to Mr. Hosseini, security
    forces had arrested a number of Nurali Elahi s followers and the members
    of the Hekmat Council in connection with the murder of Hashtgerd s Friday
    Prayer Imam. Arrest and detention Based on available information, one day
    in September-October 2009, at 5 PM, Mr. Hosseini was beaten and arrested
    following an attack by Information Ministry forces on Mr. Hosseini and his
    fellow villager, on Hashtgerd s mai
