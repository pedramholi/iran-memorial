    The execution of Mr. Hamid Reza Rustasefat was reported by HRANA Website,
    the Human Rights Activists in Iran News Agency (August 18, 2016). Mr.
    Rustasefat was 43 years old, married, and the father of two children. His
    case is related to illegal drugs crimes. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Rustasefat had been in prison since 2011. On Thursday, August 11, 2016, he
    was transferred to solitary confinement in anticipation of his execution.
    However, the detailed circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Rustasefat s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Rustasefat was transportation and
    possession of illegal drugs . The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Rustasefat s defense. Judgment Mr. Hamid Reza Rustasefat
    was sentenced to death by hanging. He was executed on Sunday August 14,
    2016, in the Gorgan Central Prison.
