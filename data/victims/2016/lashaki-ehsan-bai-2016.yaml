    He was his family s only son and had dropped out of middle school. He was
    a kind person. Like many other adolescents, he had a special interest in
    soccer, but family and social difficulties meant he was not afforded the
    chance to develop his skills. News of Mr. Ehsan Ba i Lashaki and his
    co-defendant s execution was published by HRANA News Agency and on the
    Iran Human Rights website (May 31, 2016). Additional information about
    this case was obtained from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center with a person with knowledge of the case, and from
    evidence and documentation obtained by the Center s research. Mr. Ehsan Ba
    i Lashaki, child of Ali Mohammad, was born on May 1, 1989 in the city of
    Chalus (documents available at the Boroumand Center). According to a
    person close to Lashaki, he had been wounded in the stomach area during
    military service. Because he received no money from the foundation tasked
    with providing assistance to wounded veterans, his family faced financial
    difficulties at home. This circumstance gave rise to other problems for
    the family which took a toll on Ba i Lashaki s psychological health. Ba i
    Lashaki was his family s only son and had dropped out of middle school. He
    was a kind person. Like many other adolescents, he had a special interest
    in sports, especially soccer, but family and social difficulties meant he
    was not afforded the chance to develop his skills (ABC interview with
    informed person). Mr. Ba i Lashaki s case pertained to sexual offenses.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Ba i Lashaki was arrested in the summer of 2008,
    following a complaint by a woman who claimed he and his friends had
    kidnapped and [sexually] assaulted her. In the afternoon of June 18, 2008,
    on their way from Chalus to [the city of] Noshahr, Mr. Ba i Lashaki and
    two of his friends gave a ride on their motorcycle to a student who had
    asked for their help. The girl had told them that the driver of a Peugeot
    405 had picked her up as a passenger and had intended to rape her on the
    way. The next day, the girl went to Chalus Police and stated that Mr. Ba i
    Lashaki and his friends had [sexually] assaulted her. Mr. Ba i Lashaki
    spent approximately 6 years in Noshahr Central Prison (documentation
    available at the Boroumand Center). In the first years of his
    incarceration, his family and individuals close to him were permitted
    cabin and occasionally private visits with him; in the final years,
    however, limitations were imposed on visitations, and only immediate
    family and his grandmother were allowed to be present (ABC interview with
    informed person). Mr. Ba i Lashaki s final visitation with family and a
    number of individuals close to him was held on May 30, 2016 at noon (ABC
    interview with informed person). Trial Mazandaran Province Criminal Court,
    located in Chalus and composed of a panel of five judges, tried Mr. Ba i
    Lashaki and the other defendants in the case in a single session on May 6,
    2010. The judges issued their verdict on May 6, 2010, and the verdict was
    announced to the defendants on June 2, 2010 (documentation available from
    ABC). Based on available information, a court-appointed attorney was
    designated for Mr. Ba i Lashaki; however, since the plaintiff was not at
    the trial, the attorney did not have the opportunity to question her and
    mount a defense for the defendant (documentation available at the
    Boroumand Center). According to a source familiar with the case, Mr. Ba i
    Lashaki protested that he had not been able to meet with the lawyer until
    the day the verdict was issued (ABC interview). Charges The court declared
    the charge against Mr. Ba i Lashaki as forcible rape . He was accused of
    kidnapping, rape, and robbery of the plaintiff s money and cell phone
    based on the complaint. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The Plaintiff s testimony
    during preliminary investigations, and the defendant s statements during
    interrogations, questioning by the investigating judge, and in court, were
    used as evidence against Mr. Ba i Lashaki at trial. Furthermore, the
    Medical Examiner s report alluding to injuries suffered by the plaintiff
    was also among the evidence used against him. Based on available
    documentation, it is not clear what the extent of the injuries was, what
    parts of the plaintiff s body were affected, and what caused those
    injuries. On the afternoon of June 18, 2008, Mr. Ba i Lashaki and two of
    his friends picked up a young woman college student who had asked them for
    help on a motorcycle on the road running from Chalus to Noshahr. The girl
    told them that the driver of a Peugeot 405 automobile had picked her up as
    a passenger on the road and has intended to rape her. On the following
    day, the girl reported to the police that Mr. Ba i Lashaki and his friends
    had sexually assaulted her rather than providing help (documentation
    available from ABC). Internatio
