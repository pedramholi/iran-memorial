    Convicted of sodomy, 17-year-old Hassan Afshar sat in a jail cell, his
    life in ruins. For seven months, judiciary officials kept a secret from
    him more terrible than any trial confession. News of the execution of Mr.
    Hassan Afshar was published by various sources including Amnesty
    International (August 2, 2016,) Radio Farda and Radio Zamaneh (August 3,
    2016,) and Iran Wire (August 1, 2016.) Additional information was taken
    from a section of the verdict issued by the court. Mr. Afshar, son of
    Asadollah, was a high school student residing in Arak in Markazi province.
    He was 17 years old when arrested. International laws have strictly
    prohibited capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18
    at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil
    and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran
    has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed
    before the age of eighteen. In an announcement, Amnesty International
    criticized Mr. Afshar s execution by judicial authorities in Iran, noting
    their sickening enthusiasm for putting juveniles to death as brazen
    disregard for international law. Arrest and detention Mr. Afshar was
    arrested in 2014 following a complaint of rape filed against him and two
    other adolescents. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known except that he was detained at the Rehabilitation and Correction
    Center for adolescents because he was under the legal age of 18 years old
    when arrested. Trial Branch One of the Criminal Court in Arak tried Mr.
    Afshar in 2014. It is not clear whether his attorney had been present
    during the trial or whether his attorney was a public defender or
    otherwise assigned to him. According to the verdict, Mr. Afshin Madani was
    his attorney. No detailed information is available on his trial. Charges
    The charges brought against Mr. Afshar were announced as forcible sodomy
    and possession of a pornographic film. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    According to the verdict issued by the court, the defendant s confession,
    forensics report, and a film depicting sodomy were the evidence which
    grounded the court ruling. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Afshar s defense. According to the Amnesty International report, Mr.
    Afshar had rejected the rape charge, telling the court that the sexual
    relationship had been consensual and that the plaintiff had participated
    willingly. According to the same report, he had no access to an attorney
    and the judicial authorities had rushed to issue a ruling only two months
    after the arrest. These authorities did not inform Mr. Afshar of his
    sentence for seven months. According to the verdict of Branch 24 of the
    Supreme Court, the court did not adequately investigate Afshar s case,
    including considerations of his mental development and maturity. Mr.
    Afshar was younger than 18 when the crime took place. A Summary of the
    Defects of Mr. Hassan Afshar s Legal Proceedings In the new Islamic Penal
    Code, there is a significant difference between insertive and receptive
    individuals in homosexual relations. If the relationship is consensual and
    the act of penetration has [actually] occurred, the insertive partner is
    sentenced to 100 lashes, and the receptive partner is executed. If,
    however, the homosexual act is not consensual, the insertive individual
    will be considered a rapist and sentenced to death, and the one who has
    been raped will be freed. In order to prove penetration , the judge will
    invite the accused to confess 4 times, that is, the judge will ask the
    accused to leave the courtroom 4 times and [return to] confirm his claim
    with a calm and reassured mind. In consensual relations, the receptive
    person will be subjected to the death penalty, and in non-consensual
    relations, characterized as rape, it is the rapist who will be executed.
    It was said that upon the enactment of the new Islamic Penal Code, the
    number of executions would decrease, since only one person would be
    sentenced to death instead of two. This [new law], however, has increased
    the probability of confessing and has made it easier [to do so]. In the
    past, both parties would deny that any relationship existed between them
    in order to escape the death penalty. Pursuant to the new law, however, if
    one accuses the other of rape and states that the relation was
    non-consensual, he will be spared the death penalty and his sexual partner
    will be hanged. Similarly, the person characterized as the rapist, can
    claim that the relation was consensual so that the receptive person c
