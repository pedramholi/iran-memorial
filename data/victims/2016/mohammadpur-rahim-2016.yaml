    Due to a complaint, the judge had enmity with Mr. Rahim Mohammadpur. Even
    the officers and employees of the prison were mightily dismayed by his
    execution. News and information about the execution of Mr. Rahim
    Mohammadpur, son of Fatemeh and Ahmad, was obtained through an interview
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (ABC) with one of his
    relatives (January 21, 2019) and an employee of Mahabad Prison during the
    time his death sentence was carried out (February 20, 2019), the documents
    available at the Boroumand Center, including the verdict issued by Branch
    1 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Sardasht (November 2, 2013), and
    Kordpa News Agency (October 22, 2016). Iranian authorities did not
    announce Mr. Mohammadpur and three others executions. Mr. Mohammadpur, a
    Sunni Kurd, born on February 20, 1981, was a resident of Boyuran-e Sofla
    village, Sardasht County in Azarbaijan-e Gharbi Province. He was married
    and had two children. Mr. Mohammadpur had a seventh-grade education and
    made his living through agriculture and cab driving. He had a criminal
    record (Interview with ABC, January 21, 2019). According to one of his
    relatives, Mr. Mohammadpur was an "excellent and honorable" individual
    (ABC interview, February 5, 2017). One of the prison guards also referred
    to him as a good fellow who minded his own business (ABC interview, March
    26, 2017). Mr. Mohammadpur's case was related to drug offenses. Arrest and
    detention Twelve plainclothes agents of the law enforcement s Headquarters
    for Combatting Illicit Drugs arrested Mr. Mohammadpur and his co-defendant
    with "insults and use of force" at 6 pm on August 23, 2013, in his orchard
    house in Boyuran-e Sofla village, Sardasht in the presence of his wife,
    mother and daughter (ABC interview, January 25, 2019). The agents arrested
    Mr. Mohammadpur and searched his house on the same day. He was taken to
    the Sardasht Information Administration detention center After one night,
    he was transferred to "Khaneh Mo alem", the city s Central Prison.
    According to his family, he was beaten during his detention (ABC
    interview, January 25, 2019). According to one of his relatives, although
    Mr. Mohammadpur had been transferred to prison, the authorities would not
    allow him to visit with his family for 27 days and prohibited him from
    getting a lawyer for four months after his arrest. The first time he saw
    his family in person was for no more than 15 minutes, and during the one
    year and six months he spent in detention in Sardasht Prison, they allowed
    him to see his family only three or four times and with difficulty. The
    authorities also denied him the right to make phone calls without a clear
    explanation. After 18 months, Mr. Mohammadpur was transferred to Mahabad
    Prison, where he visited his family once a month (ABC interview, January
    25, 2019). According to one of the prison guards, Mr. Mohammadpur worked
    in the cultural unit of Mahabad Prison, where he gave books to the
    prisoners, wrote petitions and prisoner requests, and was engaged in
    sewing and ironing (ABC interview, March 18, 2019). Trial The Branch 1 of
    the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Sardasht City tried Mr. Mohammadpur
    across two sessions on October 1 and December 19, 2013 (Court document,
    December 19, 2013). He had access to a lawyer in court (ABC interview,
    January 25, 2019). According to an informed person, each session of Mr.
    Mohammadpur's trial was brief and lasted about 20-30 minutes; the judge
    did not treat him well and would not permit him or his lawyer to speak
    (ABC interview, January 21, 2019). There is no further information
    available about the details of Mr. Mohammadpur's court hearings. Charges
    The charge brought against Mr. Mohammadpur was "participating in the
    production, transportation, and storage of narcotic drugs in the amount of
    one kilogram, 580 grams, and three liters of acetone" (Court document,
    December 19, 2013). The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The complaint mentions the discovery of "approximately one kilogram
    of drugs of the crystal meth-type in th
