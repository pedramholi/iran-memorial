    News of the execution of Mr. T. A., son of Ali, along with another
    individual, was announced by the website of the provincial Ministry of
    Justice office of Gilan Province (January 10, 2016), citing the Public
    Relations section of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Gilan
    Province. Additional information on this case was obtained from the
    websites of Saheb Khabar and Taftan (January 12, 2016). The case of Mr. T.
    A. pertains to trafficking illegal drugs. Arrest and d e tention There is
    no information available on the details of Mr. T. A. s arrest and
    detention. Trial Mr. T. A. was tried in the presence of his defense lawyer
    by the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Rasht. However, there is no
    information available on the details of the session or sessions of his
    trial. Char g es Mr. T. A. was charged with carrying narcotics. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of gu i lt Possessing 4 kilograms
    and 960 grams of heroin were entered as evidence of guilt against Mr. T.
    A. Defense There is no information available on the details of Mr. T. A. s
    defense. He twice appealed to the Central Commission for Amnesty, and his
    appeal was twice rejected. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Rasht sentenced Mr. T. A. to death. The verdict was validated by the Chief
    Public Prosecutor, as well as the head of the Judiciary. Mr. T. A. was
    hanged, along with another individual, in Rasht Central Prison on Sunday,
    January 10, 2016.
