    News of the execution of Mr. Mohsen Nasiri (Mojreh), along with three
    others*, was published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists
    News Agency) on January 13, 2016. Additional information was taken from
    the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation interview with an informed person on
    June 3, 2016 and documents related to this case. Mr. Nasiri, son of Nezam
    ali, was born in Khalkhal in 1985. He was raised in a crowded working
    family and worked in various jobs such as a street peddler. He was a high
    school senior but did not graduate. According to the interviewee, he was a
    funny, generous, and kind individual. He planned to marry his girlfriend
    before being arrested. The case of Mr. Nasiri was related to the
    possession of narcotics found in his sister s house. He always denied any
    information regarding the narcotics. Arrest and detention Mr. Nasiri was
    arrested at his sister s house in Fardis, Karaj, on either December 17 or
    19, 2012. Security agents attacked the house without any warrant or even
    introduction around 10 a.m. and insulted and mistreated the residents.
    They searched and ransacked the house. Agents beat up Mr. Nasiri and took
    him to an unknown location. They also took two vehicles belonging to him
    and his relatives and every cellphone in the house. He was not allowed to
    call his family for two weeks. Then Mr. Nasiri was not allowed to contact
    anybody for 40 days when authorities informed his family of his transfer
    to the Karaj Prison. He was detained in Sections 1, 4, and 5 of this
    prison where he was trusted and liked by other prisoners. After his
    transfer to the prison, he was allowed bi-weekly visits from his family.
    According to the source, Mr. Nasiri was harassed in the prison. In order
    to trap other individuals, agents pressured Mr. Nasiri s family. They
    threatened them continuously and sometimes informed the family of his
    abuse in prison to scare them. According to Mr. Nasiri s sister, his
    friend, who allegedly had put the narcotics in the storage space in her
    house, had been arrested and claimed that Mohsen Nasiri owned the
    narcotics. According to the interviewee, Mr. Nasiri had no attorney during
    the interrogation and preliminary investigation period. Trial Branch One
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Karaj, with judge Hosseini
    presiding, tried Mr. Nasiri on April 11, 2013. No information is available
    on his trial; however, according to the available information, the trial
    session was very short and when Mr. Nasiri exited the court, he showed his
    red finger to his family and informed them of his death sentence. He told
    them this meant signing his death sentence and there was no trial except
    finger printing. After the court issued the ruling, the family tried
    unsuccessfully to appeal or commute the sentence by going to various
    institutions. The request for the case to go to the Supreme Court was
    noted on January 11, 2016. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Nasiri
    was announced as possession of 4 kilograms and 400 grams of
    methamphetamine. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political and civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to the existing verdict, the evidence presented against Mr.
    Nasiri was the recovery of 4 kilograms and 400 grams of methamphetamine
    from the storage area of his sister s house and his statements and
    confession. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. Nasiri always claimed
    innocence and that he was unaware of the recovered narcotics. According to
    the existing information, the night before his arrest, a friend asked him
    to keep some alcoholic beverages for his sister s wedding party that was
    nearby. Mr. Nasiri had accepted his friend s request and gave him his car
    for this purpose. The guard of the house where Mr. Nasiri was arrested
    told agents that night that he had seen a couple put the bag (of
    narcotics) in
