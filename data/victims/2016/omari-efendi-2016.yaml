    News of execution of Mr. Efendi Omari along with seven other individuals
    was announced by the websites of Human Rights Activists News Agency
    (HRANA) and Center of Democracy and Human Rights in Kurdistan (Mafnews) on
    September 29, 2016. Additional information on this case was obtained from
    the website of Iran Human Rights (September 29, 2016). Mr. Omari was from

    sessions of Mr. Omari s trial. Charges Mr. Omari was charged with crimes
    connected to narcotics The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    There is no information available on the details of the evidence of guilt
    entered against Mr. Omari. Defense There is no information available on

    the morning of September 29, 2016 (HRANA and Mafnews, September 29, 2016).
