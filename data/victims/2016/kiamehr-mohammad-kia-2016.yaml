    The judge decided about the fate of Mohammad Kia Kiamehr (Khezr) without
    evidence relying only on his own knowledge (the knowledge of the judge).
    Muhammad was Sunni. The news of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Kiya (known
    as Khezr) Kiamehr, son of Karim, along with three other individuals* was
    obtained from Iran newspaper (June 21, 2016). Additional information was
    drawn from Abdorrahman Bouroumand Center s investigation, based on the
    review of case documents, interviews with informed sources (August 23,
    2018, September 15, 2018, and May 22, 2022). According to available
    information, 35-year-old Mr. Kiamehr was born in HaMr.an village of
    Sardasht in West Azerbaijan and lived in Tehran's Sadeqieh (Aryashahr)
    area and was engaged He studied up to fifth grade and was a builder and
    bought and sold houses in Karaj, Alborz Province. Mr. Kiamehr was also
    licensed to import and export ceramic tiles to Iraq. (Interview with an
    informed source - August 23, 2018). The case of Mr. Kiamehr was related to
    a 2011 drug-related crime. Arrest and detention According to an informed
    source, in June, July and August 2011Mr., 10 to 12 anti-narcotics agents
    entered Mr. Kiamehr s construction site in the Mardabad area of Karaj with
    several people in plain clothes, and according to the testimony of Mr.
    Kiamehr and the workers who were present, arrested him after beating,
    slapping, and kicking him, which resulted in a broken arm. During his
    arrest, one of the officers even told him: "You ought to be executed given
    that you re Sunni." Mr. Kiamehr's house was also searched on the day of
    his arrest. The agents found no evidence but took his Peugeot
    (automobile). Finally, the agents took Mr. Kiamehr to the Narcotics
    Control Department in Karaj. (ABC interview Sep. 15, 2018) Mr. Kiamehr
    stayed in this detention center for 18 days but was not allowed to visit
    or make phone calls and was constantly interrogated. The interrogators
    beat him to get a confession. After being interrogated, Mr. Kiamehr was
    transferred to ward three of Karaj Central Penitentiary, where prisoners
    using drugs were held. He was allowed visitors, only behind the cubicle
    once a week and in person once every two weeks. His lawyer met with him
    only once to sign a power of attorney. (ABC interview Sep. 15, 2018) Mr.
    Kiamehr was in prison for five years. On May 21, 2016, he visited with his
    family for the last time. The agents of the anti-narcotics headquarters
    arrested him while beating, slapping, and kicking him, which resulted in a
    broken arm. Trial The second branch of the Karaj Islamic Revolutionary
    Court tried Mr. Kiamehr in three sessions. He had two lawyers during the
    trial, but the judge did not allow them to speak and they had to submit a
    defense brief to the judge. (ABC interview Sep. 15, 2018) Charges The
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Karaj charged Mr. Kiamehr and his
    co-accused with "complicity in the manufacture and production of
    psychoactive substances and possession of narcotics." (Judgment of the
    Islamic Revolution Court of Karaj May 27, 2014) In a situation where
    minimum procedural guarantees are not observed, and the defendants are
    deprived of a fair trial, the accuracy of the crimes attributed to them is
    uncertain. International human rights organizations point to reports that,
    in some cases, the authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran falsely
    accuse their opponents (including political, civil, union, or minority
    activists) of drug trafficking or committing public and sexual crimes and
    execute them alongside ordinary criminals. Thousands of people accused of
    drug trafficking have been sentenced to death based on a judicial process
    inconsistent with international standards. Among them were those executed
    based on the 1987 law, which imposed the death penalty on traffickers who
    possessed a certain amount of drugs (5 kilograms of hashish or opium, more
    than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, or methadone). The number of people
    sentenced to death based on false accusations is unclear. Evidence of
    Guilt The evidence against Mr. Kiamehr, his co-accused's confessions, the
    defendant's fianc 's statements, the finding of a blue notebook, the
    anti-narcotic police agent s statements, the discovery of a sample of
    (ephedrine) pills in Mr. Kiamehr's car, and the discovery of two kilos and
    800 grams of methamphetamine-type psychoactive substances and the storage
    of one kilo and 300 grams of ephedrine tablets from prefabrication to
    produce psychoactive substances. Alborz province anti-narcotics agents had
    discovered the above mentioned industrial drug manufacturing workshop
    along with ephedrine bottles and tablets in the home of the primary
    defendant, Mr. Mohsen Danahur. (Karaj Islamic Revolution Court judgement -
    May 27, 2014) According to the Karaj Islamic Revolutionary Court, the
    confessions of the primary defendant and the discovery of some
    psychotropic substance pills in Mr. Kiamehr's car were the court's
    evidence for his participation in the production of psychotro
