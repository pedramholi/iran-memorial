    The execution of Mr. Qader Mazaheri was reported by the Kordestan Human
    Rights Network Website (April 11, 2016), and Nasuyu Rojhe Lot (?) (April
    12, 2016). Mr. Mazaheri was from Azarshahr, in Azarbaijan e Sharqi
    Province, and his case is related to sexual crimes. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of Mr. Mazaheri s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Mr. Mazaheri was tried by a court in Azarbaijan e Sharqi Province,
    but there is no information available on his trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Mazaheri was adultery . The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offenses, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Mazaheri s defense. Judgment The court sentenced Mr. Mazaheri to death
    by hanging. He was executed at the Tabriz Central Prison, on Monday, April
    11, 2016.
