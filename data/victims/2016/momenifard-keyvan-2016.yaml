    News of Mr. Keyvan Mo menifard and 24 other individuals execution was
    published by various sources including IRNA (August 3, 2016), IRIB News
    Agency (August 3, 2016), Fars News Agency (August 2, 2016), Khorassan
    Newspaper (August 4, 2016), HRANA (August 3, 2016), Kurdistan Human Rights
    Defenders Center (August 3, 2016), and the Amnesty International Report
    (November 17, 2016). Additional information about this execution was
    obtained through a Boroumand Foundation interview with a person close to
    Mr. Mo menifard, and from an Information Ministry Announcement (Islamic
    Republic of Iran Information Ministry website, August 3, 2016), Kurdistan
    Province Judiciary Announcement (Fars New Agency, August 2, 2016), and
    from other sources.* Mr. Mo menifard, also known as Abdorrahman, child of
    Sharif, was a Sunni Kurd from the [city of] Sanandaj. He was married, had
    a 9-year-old child, and resided in Sanandaj s Shahrak Molavi neighborhood.
    Mr. Mo menifard had an 8thgrade education and worked at the fruit and
    vegetables wholesale center, and transported fruits in his car. According
    to a person who knew him, Mr. Mo menifard was a religious man, a follower
    of the Shafe i** branch of Islam, and knew the Koran by heart. Prior to
    his arrest, he had participated in religious and faith-based classes, such
    as Vajebat, in Sanandaj. In prison, in addition to learning Ahadith, he
    continued to study and learn religious subjects of the Sunni faith. Mr. Mo
    menifard was not affiliated with any particular group or organization, and
    had moderate religious views. Mr. Mo menifard was a kind and quiet man.
    (Boroumand Foundation interview). Sunni defendants families
    correspondence, including Mr. Mo menifard s, with the Leader, the Head of
    the Judiciary, and the President, as well as sit-ins and follow-ups with
    the authorities in protesting the arrest and issuance of a death sentence,
    bore no fruit. (Boroumand Foundation interview). According to the Amnesty
    International report, security forces threatened Mr. Mo menifard s family
    and lawyers in order to prevent them from releasing information about the
    cases and to stop them from giving interviews to media and human rights
    organizations. Background Based on available information, in the years
    2007 to 2009-10, Shi a evangelists hurled numerous insults at Sunni
    beliefs and Sunni respected figures, with severe backlash from Sunni
    religious figures and activists. Following famous Shi a movie director
    Ebrahim Hatamikia s offensive statements about Aisha, the Prophet s wife,
    in Khanevadeye Sabz ( Green Family ) Magazine (Volume 195, 2007-08), and
    statements made by several well-known preachers such as Hojjatoleslams
    Daneshmand, Juybari, and Ansari whose speeches were covered by [IRIB,]
    state radio and television in certain instances a number of religious
    Sunni youth from Kurdistan (who considered these insults as being
    organized) proceeded to hold classes, distribute books and CD s in local
    mosques, universities, and their neighborhoods, protesting against these
    actions and raising awareness, as well as promoting and defending the
    tenets of the Shafe i religion.** These CD s contained documented
    instances of offensive language used against Sunni beliefs, quoted from
    well-known religious sources of the Shi a religion such as Bohar-ol-Anvar.
    The religious activities of these young people raised the security
    apparatus sensitivity. Subsequent to Ayatollah Khamenei s trip to Sanandaj
    in April-May 2009, several young Sunni Kurd religious activists were
    arrested in the name of fighting Salafi and Takfiri (term used to denote
    Sunni extremists such as al-Qaeda and ISIS) movements. Three months later,
    a number of assassinations were carried out in Sanandaj, including Mamusta
    Sheikh-ol-Eslam, member of the Assembly of Experts, and Molla Borhan Aali,
    a Sunni cleric. Security forces accused certain individuals of murder, who
    had been arrested after these assassinations. The arrestees denied any
    connection to armed, extremist, or radical groups, objected to the charges
    brought against them, and asked for a new and public trial, to no avail.
    Ultimately, six of the arrestees were executed in December 2012-January
    2013, and six others on March 4, 2015. Also, continuing this process, 25
    others, named the Unity and Jihad Group , were put to death on August 2,
    2016. The issuance and implementation of the death penalty for this group
    of Sunni adherents, was followed by the reaction of numerous domestic and
    international individuals and organizations. On June 12, 2014, eighteen
    human rights organizations, including the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation
    and a human rights lawyer, protested the sentences in a declaration and
    demanded that they be rescinded. Furthermore, Amnesty International, Human
    Rights Watch, Human Rights Defenders, and the Abdorrahman Borumand
    Foundation (December 31, 2014) issued several declarations and calls to
    action, demanding the rescission of the death sentences issued for the
    defendants of the
