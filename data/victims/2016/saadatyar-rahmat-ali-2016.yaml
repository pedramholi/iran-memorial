    The execution of Mr. Rahmat Ali Sa'adatyar, along with two other people,
    was reported by HRANA Website, the Human Rights Activists in Iran News
    Agency (September 26, 2016). Mr. Sa'adatyar was 40 years old and he was
    from Garmsar. His case has to do with illegal drugs crimes in 2011. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Sa'adatyar spent five years in prison. However, the
    detailed circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Sa'adatyar s trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Sa'adatyar was crimes related to illegal drugs . The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Sa'adatyar s defense. Judgment Mr. Rahmat Ali Sa'adatyar was sentenced
    to death by hanging. He was executed, along with another person*, at
    Shahrud Prison in Semnan Province, on Thursday September 22, 2016.
