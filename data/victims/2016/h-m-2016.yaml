    News of the execution of Mr. M. H., along with two other individuals, was
    announced by the news and analysis website of Sohbat (January 10, 2016),
    citing an informed authority, as well as the website of the Fars Province
    Office of Radio and Television (January 11, 2016), citing the head of the
    provincial Ministry of Justice office of Larestan. Mr. M. H., between 35
    and 40 years old, was from the Kuwar or Kouhmareh Sorkhi counties of Fars
    Province. His case pertains to armed trafficking of illegal drugs. Arrest
    and detention Mr. M. H. was arrested by the police force in the course of
    an armed struggle along the Shiraz-Bandar Abbas Road in April/May 2015.
    One of the traffickers was killed during the struggle. After the records
    of the killed trafficker were investigated, it became clear that he had
    been a murderer and a convict who had escaped from Eqlid Prison. Mr. M. H.
    spent eight months in prison. However, there is no further information
    available on the details of his arrest and detention. Trial Mr. M. H. went
    on trial in Fars Province. However, there is no information available on
    the details of the session or sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. M. H. was
    charged with armed trafficking of illegal drugs. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information available on details of
    the evidence of guilt entered against Mr. M. H. Defense There is no
    information available on the details of Mr. M. H. s defense. Judgment Mr.
    M. H. was sentenced to death. His verdict was issued on November 18, 2015.
    Mr. M. H. was hanged, along with two other individuals, in the courtyard
    of Larestan Prison on January 10, 2016. The issued verdict stated that the
    convicts should be hanged publicly; however, for security reasons they
    were hanged inside the prison.
