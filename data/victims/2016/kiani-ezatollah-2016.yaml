    The execution of Mr. Ezatollah Kiani, along with another person, was
    reported by the Society for the Protection of Prisoners Families (May 6,
    2016). Mr. Kiani s case is related to murder. Arrest and detention The

    information is available on Mr. Kiani s trial. Charges The charge brought
    against Mr. Kiani was murder . The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that

    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
