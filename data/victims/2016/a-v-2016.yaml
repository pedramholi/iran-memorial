    News of the execution of Mr. V. A., son of Mohammad Taqi, along with
    another individual was announced by the website of the provincial Ministry
    of Justice office of Gilan Province (January 10, 2016), citing the Public
    Relations section of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Gilan
    Province. Additional information on this case was obtained from the
    websites of Saheb Khabar and Taftan (January 12, 2016). The case of Mr. V.
    A. pertains to trafficking illegal drugs. Arrest and detention There is no
    information available on the details of Mr. V. A. s arrest and detention.
    Trial Mr. V. A. was tried in the presence of his defense lawyer by the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Rasht. However, there is no information
    available on the details of the session or sessions of his trial. Charges
    Mr. V. A. was charged with purchase and possession of narcotics. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt Having multiple criminal
    records as well as storing 87 grams of heroin were entered as evidence of
    guilt against Mr. V. A. Defense There is no information available on the
    details of Mr. V. A. s defense. He twice appealed to the Central
    Commission for Amnesty, and his appeal was rejected twice. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Rasht sentenced Mr. V. A. to death. The
    verdict was validated by the Chief Public Prosecutor as well as the head
    of the Judiciary. Mr. V. A. was hanged along with another individual in
    Rasht Central Prison on Sunday, January 10, 2016.
