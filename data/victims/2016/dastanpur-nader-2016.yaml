    died a day after his arrest at the detention center of police station, due
    to the severity of the injuries caused during his arrest and the failure
    to provide appropriate treatments. Information regarding the death of Mr.
    Nader Dastanpur, son of Ali, in custody in Narmak police station was
    obtained through Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interview with an informed
    person on February 2, 2018. The news of Mr. Dastanpur s death in custody
    was initially announced by HRANA- Human Rights Activists News Agency (July
    6, 2016). Additional information about this extrajudicial death has been
    obtained from HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) (July 8 and 11,
    2016), Tasnim News Agency (July 8, 2016), and documents available at
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center including the court decision by the Supreme
    Court Branch 19, body examination report, and the report made by Iranian
    Legal Medicine Organization on the cause of Mr. Dastanpur s death. Also,
    the neighbors and local residents who witnessed the manner in which police
    officers arrested Mr. Dastanpur, signed a testimony to describe the
    circumstances. Mr. Dastanpur was the second child of his family. Mr.
    Dastanpur, worked at a store in Narmak Square along with his father.
    According to a family member, he was very well-regarded in the
    neighborhood and he really liked sports. Arrest and Detention Mr.
    Dastanpur, along with his brother, was arrested on June 16, 2016 in his
    father s home by police officers and was detained in the detention center
    at Narmak police station. The statements of the authorities regarding the
    reasons and the manner of his detention are completely contradictory with
    his family s statements. According to the Narmak police station s Chief s
    report, on June 16, 2016, following an anonymous complaint against Mr.
    Y.D. (Mr. Nader Dastanpur s brother) regarding an attempt to steal a
    motorcycle at 90thSquare in Narmak, Mr. Y.D. and his brother (Mr. Nader
    Dastanpur) were involved in a fight with police officers and then hid in
    their home which was nearby. Accordingly, the court order to enter their
    home was obtained and both suspects were arrested while intoxicated and
    transferred to the police station (Tasnim News Agency). However, according
    to a source close to the family, police officers wanted to enter the
    Dastanpurs home without a court order, and the family thus refused them
    access. The officers asked for backup, and after a while, they broke the
    door and entered forcefully. As witnesses testified, the officers beat the
    Dastanpur family with their boots and batons and used pepper spray. Then
    they put Mr. Dastanpur into their car trunk by force while his face and
    head were injured and bleeding (HRANA, July 6, 2016). The statements of
    the authorities regarding the reasons and the manner of Mr. Dastanpur s
    detention are completely contradictory with his family s statements. A
    member of the Dastanpur family described the event as follows: Since Nader
    and his father worked as shopkeepers, they came back home around 3 or 4 in
    the morning and were asleep until 1:00 PM, when the police officers
    entered their home. The officers asked Nader s elder brother to accompany
    them to the police station based on a complaint. He asked the officers for
    a summons, which they did not have. A short time after, when the backup
    officers arrived, the officers entered the home forcefully without a
    warrant, while Nadir and his father were sleeping. On that particular day,
    Nader did not go out at all. After the officers began to beat Nader and
    his brother while using pepper spray, Nader s father got involved. Then
    the officers handcuffed him and beat Nader s head and face with batons and
    boots before his eyes. Nader first saw the officers while he was sleeping
    and had never seen them before that day. Before the officers entrance, one
    family member had called 197 [the complaint hotline for the Law
    Enforcement Force of the Islamic Republic of Iran General Inspection] to
    make a report on police officers attempt to enter their property without a
    warrant. This call is recorded (HRANA, July 8, 2016). In this regard, the
    HRANA website has published photographs of Mr. Dastanpur s injured face,
    as well as fractures on their home door. The interrogator of the 7thBranch
    of the Prosecutor s Office of Tehran s District 4, tried Mr. Dastanpur. No
    information is available on the details of the interrogation, except the
    point that the investigator, in spite of observing Mr. Dastanpur s
    injuries, had issued a 24-hour extension of his detention instead of
    sending him to the hospital for treatment (HRANA, July 6, 2016). While in
    detention, Mr. Dastanpur did not have access to a lawyer. Photographs of
    Mr. Dastanpur s injured face, as well as fractures on their home door is
    available. Death of Mr. Nader Dastanpur Mr. Nader Dastanpur died a day
    after his arrest at the detention center of Narmak police station, due to
