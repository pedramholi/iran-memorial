    News and information about the execution of Mr. Majid Parmasi, son of
    Qovatollah, was obtained from an Abdorrahman Boroumand Center interview
    with two informed sources, on July 20, 2016 and July 21, 2016. News of
    this execution was also published in Iran Newspaper on July 21, 2016.
    Additional information was gleaned from the court s verdict, recorded in
    the Boroumand Center archives. Mr. Parmasi was from the town of Karaj in
    Alborz Province. Mr. Parmasi was self-employed and he was single (Center
    Interview, July 21, 2016) Mr. Parmasi and his co-defendant s case was
    related to drug charges. Arrest and detention The circumstances and exact
    details of Mr. Parmasi s arrest and detention are not known. However, an
    informed source told Abdorrahman Boroumand Center that he had been
    arrested in Karaj by The agents of Information Department of Alborz
    Province on February 11, 2013 (Documents available at Boroumand Center,
    July 20 and 21, 2016). Also, according to the court verdict of his
    co-defendant, Mr. Parmasi and his co-defendant had been arrested by
    narcotics officers of the Information Ministry at a poultry breeding
    facility. According to this verdict, which was handed down by the Chief
    Public Prosecutor s Office on September 29, 2013, the location of arrest
    was rented by Mr. Parmasi, the primary defendant in this case (Documents
    available at Boroumand Center, July 20 and 21, 2016). Mr. Parmasi was
    incarcerated in Hall #2 at Karaj Penitentiary (ABC Interview, July 20 and
    21, 2016). Trial Mr. Parmasi s trial was conducted by the Revolutionary
    Court of Karaj, Branch 4, Judge Farajollahi presiding, in July of 2013.
    Mr. Parmasi had a Lawyer. (ABC Interview, July 20 and 21, 2016) There is
    not a complete record of the method of interrogation in the preliminary
    investigation, or in court. This case was sent to the revolutionary court
    of Karaj, after a guilty verdict and an indictment was issued. Charges
    According to the verdict, the charge brought against Mr. Parmasi was
    specifically, manufacturing and possession of 6,150 grams psychedelic
    drugs (crystal meth) (ABC Interview, July 21, 2016). It should be noted
    that in an interview given after the sentence was carried out, the Karaj
    Prosecutor did not mention a specific charge for Mr. Parmasi (Iran
    Newspaper, July 21, 2016). The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt According to the verdict of the court, the confessions of the
    accused in this case while they were held by the Information Ministry, and
    also being present in the location where psychedelic drugs were
    manufactured and where implements for this operation were found were taken
    as evidence of guilt in this case and reasons to support their conviction
    (Documents available at Boroumand Center, July 8, 2015). According to the
    Karaj prosecutor, in later investigations, it became clear that these
    individuals had several criminal records, including narcotics smuggling.
    The prosecutor did not give any details about these criminal records or
    about Mr. Parmasi s personal record (Iran Newspaper, July 21, 2016).
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense According to the verdict on the case of another
    defendant, although during the preliminary investigation carried out by
    the information office, Mr. Parmasi had confessed , in the initial phases
    he had named other individuals as partners in the manufacturing operation.
    Later on, including in court, he denied having manufactured and stored
    psychedelic drugs (Documents available at Boroumand Center, July 8, 2015).
    No further information is available on Mr. Parmasi s defense. A Summary of
    the Defects of Mr. Parmasi s Legal Proceedings According to the court
    ruling issued by Branch Four of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Karaj,
    Mr. Majid Parmasi had only confessed to producing methamphetamine durin
