    Mr. Rahimi, a mathematics student, dropped out of college due to poverty,
    and started to haul passengers around for a living News of Mr. Mohammad
    Yavar Rahimi and 24 other individuals execution was published by various
    sources including IRNA (August 3, 2016), IRIB News Agency (August 3,
    2016), Fars News Agency (August 2, 2016), Khorassan Newspaper (August 4,
    2016), HRANA (August 3, 2016), Kurdistan Human Rights Defenders Center
    (August 3, 2016), and the Amnesty International Report (November 17,
    2016). Additional information about this execution was obtained through a
    Boroumand Foundation interview with a person close to Mr. Rahimi, from an
    Information Ministry Announcement (Islamic Republic of Iran Information
    Ministry website, August 3, 2016), Kurdistan Province Judiciary
    Announcement (Fars New Agency, August 2, 2016), and from other sources.*
    Mr. Mohammad Yavar Rahimi, child of Nasser, was a Sunni Kurd from [the
    city of] Sanandaj. He resided in Sanandaj s Qaradian neighborhood. Mr.
    Rahimi was a mathematics student at [the town of] Marivan s Payam-e Nur
    University, but dropped out due to financial difficulty and started moving
    passengers around in his car in Sanandaj. According to a person who knew
    him, Mr. Rahimi was a religious man, a follower of the Shafe i** branch of
    Islam, but was not affiliated with any particular group or organization.
    He had not participated in any religious and faith-based classes of the
    adherents of the Sunni faith prior to his arrest, and had simply read
    Sunni religious books on his own, including Imam Shafe i s book. Based on
    available information, one year prior to his arrest and following his
    brother s arrest***, Mr. Rahimi found out that security forces had the
    intention of arresting him as well. He was forced to flee, even though he
    saw no reason why he should be arrested. He lived in hiding and in poverty
    in one of Iran s northern towns for one year. The day after his brother s
    arrest, around 6 AM, 40 armed and masked Revolutionary Guards plainclothes
    agents had swarmed his brother s home but he was not there. After they had
    searched the house and confiscated Mr. Rahimi s books, they had arrested
    the two brothers wives and had taken them to one of the Revolutionary
    Giards centers located at Shapur Street in Sanandaj. They did not allow
    them to contact their families. The security forces denied Mr. Rahimi s
    wife s and his brother s wife s request to bring a female officer for the
    search and arrest. Mr. Rahimi s and his brother s wife were released at
    noon that same day. Mr. Rahimi was a quiet and patient man, and in
    addition to studying religious and faith-based subjects of the adherents
    of the Sunni faith in prison, he also learned the Koran and Imam Shafe i s
    book by heart. (Boroumand Foundation interview). Sunni defendants families
    correspondence, including Mr. Rahimi s, with the Leader, the Head of the
    Judiciary, and the President, as well as sit-ins and follow-ups with the
    authorities in protesting the arrest and issuance of a death sentence,
    bore no fruit. (Boroumand Foundation interview). According to the Amnesty
    International report, security forces threatened Mr. Rahimi s family and
    lawyers in order to prevent them from releasing information about the
    cases and to stop them from giving interviews to media and human rights
    organizations. Background Based on available information, in the years
    2007 to 2009-10, Shi a evangelists hurled numerous insults at Sunni
    beliefs and Sunni respected figures, with severe backlash from Sunni
    religious figures and activists. Following famous Shi a movie director
    Ebrahim Hatamikia s offensive statements about Aisha, the Prophet s wife,
    in Khanevadeye Sabz ( Green Family ) Magazine (Volume 195, 2007-08), and
    statements made by several well-known preachers such as Hojjatoleslams
    Daneshmand, Juybari, and Ansari whose speeches were covered by [IRIB,]
    state radio and television in certain instances a number of religious
    Sunni youth from Kurdistan (who considered these insults as being
    organized) proceeded to hold classes, distribute books and CD s in local
    mosques, universities, and their neighborhoods, protesting against these
    actions and raising awareness, as well as promoting and defending the
    tenets of the Shafe i religion.** These CD s contained documented
    instances of offensive language used against Sunni beliefs, quoted from
    well-known religious sources of the Shi a religion such as Bohar-ol-Anvar.
    The religious activities of these young people raised the security
    apparatus sensitivity. Subsequent to Ayatollah Khamenei s trip to Sanandaj
    in April-May 2009, several young Sunni Kurd religious activists were
    arrested in the name of fighting Salafi and Takfiri (term used to denote
    Sunni extremists such as al-Qaeda and ISIS) movements. Three months later,
    a number of assassinations were carried out in Sanandaj, including Mamusta
    Sheikh-ol-Eslam, member of the Assembly of Experts, and Molla Borhan Aali,
    a Sunni cleric. Security forces
