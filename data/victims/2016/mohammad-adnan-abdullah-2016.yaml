    Information about the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Adnan Abdullah
    Mohammad, son of Mohammad and Nazifeh, was taken from an Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center interview with the brother of Mr. Adnan Abdullah Mohammad
    (March 12, 2021). News of this killing was also published on the official
    website of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, Kurdistan u Kurd (December 22,
    2016), and on the Raja News website (December 21, 2016). Additional
    information about this case was obtained through interviews conducted by
    the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with Mr. Kamal Karimi, member of the
    Kurdistan Democratic Party s political office February 5, 2021; December
    22, 2021), with a person with knowledge of the case (February 19, 2021),
    the Kurdistan Democratic Party s By-Laws ratified during the Party s 16 th
    Congress (January - February 2016), and other sources.* Mr. Adnan Abdullah
    Mohammad was Kurdish and he was Sunni Muslim. He was born on July 5, 1981,
    in the town of Erbil in Iraq s Kurdistan State, and he was married. He had
    a high school diploma and lived in Koy in Iraqi Kurdistan. Mr. Adnan
    Abdullah was a member of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan since 1999 and
    was employed as a police officer that same year in the town of Koy.
    Starting in 2000, he worked at the Public Security Office of the town of
    Sulaymaniyah for several years. After that Mr. Adnan Abdullah was elected
    to be the Deputy Head of Security in the Makhmur region. Mr. Adnan
    Abdullah Mohammad s last responsibility was Head of the Checkpoint on the
    road to the headquarters of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, which was
    under the jurisdiction of the government of Iraqi Kurdistan (Boroumand
    Center Interview, March 12, 2021). According to Mr. Adnan Abdullah s
    brother, he was a pleasant, sociable, and religious man (Boroumand Center
    Interview, March 12, 2021). The Kurdish Problem in the Islamic Republic
    After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the disagreements between the
    government of the Shiite Islamic Republic and the organizations in the
    Kurdish regions of western Iran regarding the rights and roles of
    minorities in drafting the Constitution; whether the government should be
    secular or religious, and especially the issue of Kurdish autonomy; and
    conflicts that resulted in Kurdish political organizations boycotting the
    April 1979 Referendum on instituting an Islamic Republic; led to serious,
    and at times armed, clashes between the central government and the
    Peshmerga (Kurdistan Democratic Party s armed forces). On August 19, 1979,
    Ayatollah Khomeini labeled the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan
    (PDKI), the oldest and most influential Kurdish Party, the Party of the
    Devil , and declared it unofficial and illegal , and ordered a military
    attack on Kurdistan. Mass executions and intense armed clashes continued
    in the region for months, clashes that resulted in the deaths of a number
    of civilians and the displacement and relocation of the residents of
    certain towns. In the next four years, Kurdish parties lost their grip on
    power in the region to a great extent, and relocated to Iraqi Kurdistan.
    Since then, a number of their leaders and members have been assassinated
    outside Iran, especially in Iraqi Kurdistan. In the years since the
    Islamic Republic has been in existence, in addition to such entities as
    the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, Komala (Revolutionary
    Organization of the Toilers of Iranian Kurdistan), the Koran School led by
    Ahmad Moftizadeh, Organization of Iranian Kurdistan Struggle (which was
    active in the early years of the Revolution), certain other Kurdish
    opposition parties were established outside Iran, such as the Kurdistan
    Free Life Party (PJAK) and the Kurdistan Freedom Party (PAK). These
    parties, with policies and ideologies that are not necessarily similar and
    uniform, have settled in parts of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region in Iraq,
    such as Koy, Soleimanieh, and in the foothills of Qandil mountains. Some
    of these parties have undergone splits in recent years. These conflicts
    have been more about the methods of running the organizations rather than
    theoretical and ideological differences. These parties have not controlled
    any part of the Iranian territory since the late 1980 s, and have adopted
    different strategies in different periods in order to confront the Islamic
    Republic, advance their political objectives, and recruit members.
    Beginning in 2006, the conflicts between the regime and Kurdish parties
    who had increased their presence in Iran in reaction to the government
    intensifying the detention and execution of Kurdish activists and the
    spread of fundamentalist beliefs in Kurdish regions entered a new and more
    serious phase. Kurdish forces, especially the Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan and the PJAK, were attacked several times inside Iran and in
    Iraqi Kurdistan border regions by border patrol forces and the
    revolutionary Guards. That same year, Revolutionary Guards conducted armed
    attacks against the positions of Iranian Kurdish part
