    was hanged in Karaj Central Prison along with three other people on July
    25, 2016. News and information regarding Mr. Mehdi Bami s execution along
    with three other people was obtained through Abdorrahman Boroumand Center
    s interview with one of his cellmates in Karaj s Central Prison on July
    20, 25, and 26, 2016. The news of this execution was confirmed by an
    informed person who spoke with a staff member at Karaj s Central Prison.

    court order, Mr. Bami was transferred to solitary confinement in Karaj
    Central Prison. His last visit with his family took place on July 24, 2016
    (ABC interview). The circumstances of Mr. Bami s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Bami s trial. Charges
    The charge brought against Mr. Bami was storing drugs (ABC interview). The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence provided
    against Mr. Bami was approximately 3 kilograms of drugs (ABC interview).
    The report of this execution does not contain detailed information
    regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Bami. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Bami s defense. Judgment Mr. Mehdi Bami was hanged in
    Karaj Central Prison along with Mr. Jamshid Dini , Mr. Mr. Majid Farjad
    Pezeshk , and Reza Teimouri on July 25, 2016. There is no information on
    the verdict leading to this execution.
