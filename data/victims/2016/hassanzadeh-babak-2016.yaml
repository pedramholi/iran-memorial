    News of execution of Mr. Babak Hassanzadeh along with another person was
    published on the website of Iran Human Rights on November 08, 2016. Mr.
    Hassanzadeh was from Sardasht in Kordestan and his case was related to
    drug offenses. Arrest and detention Mr. Hassanzadeh was arrested on the
    road from Hamedan to Qorveh. He was in Hamedan Prison until October 2016
    when he was transferred to Qorveh Prison. He had his last visitation with
    his family on November 05, 2016. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Hassanzadeh s trial. Charges According to Iran Human Rights organization,
    Mr. Hassanzadeh was charged with carrying 350 grams of Crystal . The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of prescribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Hassanzadeh s defense. Judgment There is no information on the verdict
    leading to this execution. Mr. Hassanzadeh was hanged in Qorveh Prison in
    the morning of Tuesday November 08, 2016. Mr. Hassanzadeh was transferred
    to a solitary confinement in Qorveh Prison a day prior to his execution.
