    The execution of Mr. Manuchehr Razani, and three other people*, on April
    19, 2016, was reported by HRANA News Service. Mr. Manuchehr Razani, son of
    Shams Ali, was from the village of Razan, Khorramabad. His case has to do
    with illegal drugs. Arrest and detention According to available
    information, Mr. Razani spent three and a half years in prison. The
    circumstances of Mr. Razani s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Razani s trial. Charges According to
    available information, the charge brought against Mr. Razani has to do
    with 850-900 grams heroin . However, there is no information on the
    details of his charges. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Razani s defense. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress . Judgment The court
    sentenced Mr. Razani to death by hanging. Mr. Razani and three other
    defendants were executed on Tuesday, April 19, 2016, in Orumieh Prison.
