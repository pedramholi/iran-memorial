    The execution of Mr. Abdolhamid Moradi, and three other people* on April
    19, 2016, was reported by HRANA News Service. Mr Abdolhamid Moradi, son of
    Safy eddin, was from Sooma, Baradoost, in the vicinity of Orumieh. His
    case has to do with illegal drugs. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of his arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Moradi spent approximately
    four and a half years in prison. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Moradi s trial. Charges According to available information, the charge
    brought against Mr. Moradi had to do with seven kilograms heroin. There is
    no detailed information on his charges. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Moradi's defense. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress .
    Judgment The court sentenced Mr. Abdolhamid Moradi to death by hanging.
    Mr. Moradi, and three other defendants, were executed on Tuesday April 19,
    2016, in Orumieh Prison. ----------------------------- Messers: Manuchehr
