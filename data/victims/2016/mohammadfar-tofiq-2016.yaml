    News of the execution of Mr. Tofiq Mohammadfar, along with four other
    individuals, was announced by the website of Human Rights Defenders
    Association of Kurdistan (January 6, 2006). Mr. Mohammadfar was from
    Sardasht and his case pertains to crimes connected to narcotics. Arrest
    and deten t ion Mr. Mohammadfar was imprisoned in Ward 12 of Tabriz
    Central Prison. However, there is no information available on the details
    of his arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Mohammadfar went on trial in East
    Azarbaijan Province. However, there is no information available on the
    details of the session or sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. Mohammadfar
    was charged with crimes connected to narcotics. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information available on the
    details of the evidence of guilt entered against Mr. Mohammadfar. Defense
    There is no information available on the details of Mr. Mohammadfar s
    defense. Judg m ent Mr. Tofiq Mohammadfar was sentenced to death. He was
    hanged, along with three other individuals, in the courtyard of Tabriz
    Central Prison on Wednesday, January 6, 2006.
