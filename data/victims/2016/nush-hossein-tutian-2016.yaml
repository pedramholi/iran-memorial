    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein Tutian Nush, along with three other
    individuals*, was announced by the website of the Human Rights Activists
    News Agency (HRANA) on January 13, 2016. The case of Mr. Tutian Nush
    pertains to crimes connected to illegal drugs. The judiciary authorities
    and organizations did not post any news items regarding Mr. Tutian Nush s
    case. Arrest and detention Mr. Tutian Nush was transferred to solitary
    confinement on January 10, 2016. However, there is no information
    available on the details of his arrest and detention. Trial There is no
    information available on the details of the session or sessions of Mr.
    Tutian Nush s trial. Charges Mr. Tutian Nush was charged with crimes
    connected to illegal drugs. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt There is no information available on the details of the evidence of
    guilt entered against Mr. Tutian Nush. Defense There is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Tutian Nush s defense. Judgment Mr.
    Hossein Tutian Nush was hanged, along with three other individuals, in
    Karaj Central Penitentiary Prison on Tuesday January 12, 2016.
