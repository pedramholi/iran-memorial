    In the 18 months Mr. Gharibi was held at Sanandaj Information [detention
    center] without visitations, his father s eyesight was severely impaired
    and his wife developed a nervous twitch News of Mr. Mohammad Gharibi and
    24 other individuals execution was published by various sources including
    IRNA (August 3, 2016), IRIB News Agency (August 3, 2016), Fars News Agency
    (August 2, 2016), Khorassan Newspaper (August 4, 2016), HRANA (August 3,
    2016), Kurdistan Human Rights Defenders Center (August 3, 2016), and the
    Amnesty International Report (November 17, 2016). Additional information
    about this execution was obtained through Boroumand Foundation research
    and interview with a person close to Mr. Gharibi, from an Information
    Ministry Announcement (Islamic Republic of Iran Information Ministry
    website, August 3, 2016), Kurdistan Province Judiciary Announcement (Fars
    New Agency, August 2, 2016), and from other sources.* Mr. Mohammad Gharibi
    was a Sunni Kurd from the [city of] Sanandaj. He was married, had a
    10-year-old son, and resided in Sanandaj s Shahrak Pardis neighborhood. He
    had a 6th grade education and was an electrician. According to a person
    who knew him, Mr. Gharibi was a religious man, a follower of the Shafe i**
    branch of Islam, and knew the Koran by heart. Prior to his arrest in
    Sanandaj, he had participated in religious classes in a very serious way.
    He was not affiliated with any particular group or organization, and had
    moderate religious views. Mr. Gharibi was a personable and good-tempered
    man who cared very much about his parents. (Boroumand Foundation
    interview). In an open letter about his son, his father wrote: My son
    liked the mosque and participated in mass prayers; he always went to the
    mosque prior to his arrest. He stayed up all night during the month of
    Ramadan. Everyone in the neighborhood like my son. And everyone is now
    saddened by his absence. I am old now and I was hoping that he would help
    me in my old age, but on the contrary, he has caused me great sadness and
    pain (HRANA, April 23, 2014). According to a person close to Mr. Gharibi,
    his father s eyesight deteriorated after his arrest due to excessive
    crying, and his wife developed a nervous twitch following psychological
    pressure brought on by the search and inspection of her home by Sanandaj
    Information Administration agents. Sunni defendants families
    correspondence, including Mr. Gharibi s, with the Leader, the Head of the
    Judiciary, and the President, as well as sit-ins and follow-ups with the
    authorities in protesting the arrest and issuance of a death sentence,
    bore no fruit. (Boroumand Foundation interview). Background Based on
    available information, in the years 2007 to 2009-10, Shi a evangelists
    hurled numerous insults at Sunni beliefs and Sunni respected figures, with
    severe backlash from Sunni religious figures and activists. Following
    famous Shi a movie director Ebrahim Hatamikia s offensive statements about
    Aisha, the Prophet s wife, in Khanevadeye Sabz ( Green Family ) Magazine
    (Volume 195, 2007-08), and statements made by several well-known preachers
    such as Hojjatoleslams Daneshmand, Juybari, and Ansari whose speeches were
    covered by [IRIB,] state radio and television in certain instances a
    number of religious Sunni youth from Kurdistan (who considered these
    insults as being organized) proceeded to hold classes, distribute books
    and CD s in local mosques, universities, and their neighborhoods,
    protesting against these actions and raising awareness, as well as
    promoting and defending the tenets of the Shafe i religion.** These CD s
    contained documented instances of offensive language used against Sunni
    beliefs, quoted from well-known religious sources of the Shi a religion
    such as Bohar-ol-Anvar. The religious activities of these young people
    raised the security apparatus sensitivity. Subsequent to Ayatollah
    Khamenei s trip to Sanandaj in April-May 2009, several young Sunni Kurd
    religious activists were arrested in the name of fighting Salafi and
    Takfiri (term used to denote Sunni extremists such as al-Qaeda and ISIS)
    movements. Three months later, a number of assassinations were carried out
    in Sanandaj, including Mamusta Sheikh-ol-Eslam, member of the Assembly of
    Experts, and Molla Borhan Aali, a Sunni cleric. Security forces accused
    certain individuals of murder, who had been arrested after these
    assassinations. The arrestees denied any connection to armed, extremist,
    or radical groups, objected to the charges brought against them, and asked
    for a new and public trial, to no avail. Ultimately, six of the arrestees
    were executed in December 2012-January 2013, and six others on March 4,
    2015. Also, continuing this process, 25 others, named the Unity and Jihad
    Group , were put to death on August 2, 2016. The issuance and
    implementation of the death penalty for this group of Sunni adherents, was
    followed by the reaction of numerous domestic and international
    individuals and organizations. On June 12, 2014, eighteen h
