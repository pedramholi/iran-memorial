    Mohsen Danahur was only 26 years old and was married. The news of the
    execution of Mr. Mohsen Danahur, the son of Sakhawat, along with three
    other people*, was obtained from the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s
    investigation and review of case documents, interviews with several
    informed sources (July 19, 2016, August 23, 2019, and May 22, 2022) and
    Iran newspaper (June 21, 2016). Mr. Danahur was 26 years old, born in
    Tehran and married. (ABC interview July 19, 2016) The case of Mr. Danahur
    was connected to a 2011 drug-related crimes. Arrest and detention
    According to available information, Mr. Danahur was arrested at his
    mother's house, which was also his residence. According to Karaj General
    and Revolution Prosecutor: "With the efforts of Alborz province
    anti-narcotics police officers, he was identified and arrested in a raid
    in an underground workshop." The date of his arrest is not known. Mr.
    Danahur was in Karaj Central Penitentiary for five years. He was held in
    hall five of the Karaj Central Prison before being transferred to a
    solitary cell. His final visit took place on Monday, July 18, 2016. (ABC
    interview August 23, 2019) Trial Branch 2 of the Karaj Islamic Revolution
    Court tried Mr. Danahur. He had a lawyer in court. But there is no
    information about his court session or sessions. (Judgment of the Islamic
    Revolution Court of Karaj May 27, 2014) Charges The Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Karaj announced Mr. Danahur's charges as "participation in the
    manufacture and production of psychoactive substances and possession of
    narcotics." (Islamic Revolution Court of Karaj- May 22, 2014) Based on the
    available information, Alborz province anti-narcotics agents attacked Mr.
    Danahur's house and discovered a drug-manufacturing laboratory and some
    drugs. (Interview with an informed source - August 23, 2018). In a
    situation where minimum procedural guarantees are not observed and the
    defendants are deprived of a fair trial, the veracity of the crimes
    attributed to them is not certain. International human rights
    organizations point to reports that the Islamic Republic of Iran
    authorities sometimes falsely accuse their opponents (including political,
    civil, union, ethnic and religious or minority activists) of drug
    trafficking or committing public and sexual crimes and execute them along
    with other ordinary convicts. Thousands of people accused of drug
    trafficking have been sentenced to death based on a judicial process
    inconsistent with international standards. Many were executed based on the
    1368 (1987) law, which imposed the death penalty on traffickers who
    possessed a certain amount of drugs (five kilograms of hashish or opium,
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, or methadone). The number of people
    who have been sentenced to death based on false accusations is not known.
    Evidence of Guilt Evidence against Mr. Danahur as specified in the court s
    ruling were his confessions, the statements of the second defendant's
    fianc , the discovery of a blue notebook, the statements by the narcotics
    agent, the discovery of a sample of (ephedrine) pills found in Mr.
    Kiamehr's car, and the discovery of two kilos and 800 grams of
    methamphetamine-type psychoactive substances and the storage of one kilo
    and 300 grams of ephedrine tablets from prefabrication to produce
    psychoactive substances,. (Karaj Islamic Revolution Court Judgment May 22,
    2014). International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned
    the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for the systematic use of
    severe torture and the use of solitary confinement to extract confessions
    from prisoners and have questioned the authenticity of the confessions
    obtained from the accused under pressure. Defense There is no information
    available about Mr. Danahur's defense. In an interview with the Iran Daily
    newspaper, the Karaj General and Revolutionary Prosecutor stressed that
    Mr. Danahur and other defendants "had numerous criminal records, including
    drug trafficking". In contrast, in the court s ruling, Mr. Danahur and the
    other defendants are presented as having no criminal record. (Judgment of
    the Islamic Revolution Court of Karaj May 27, 2014) The decision issued by
    branch 2 of the Islamic Revolution Court was issued by relying on the
    knowledge of the judge rather than based on the available evidence. (the
    text of the defense by Mr. Mohammad-Kia Kiamehr s lawyer; the other
    defendant in the case) Judgment Branch 2 of the Revolutionary Court of
    Karaj, Relying on Article 211 (Judge's Knowledge) on August 23, 2014,
    condemned Mr. Mohsen Danahur to execution and confiscation of property
    resulting from the same crime for participating in the manufacture,
    production, and possession of psychoactive substances based on Clause six
    of Article eight of the Anti-Narcotics Law Amendment Law and Clause three
    of Articles five and four of the Amendment Law***. The court further
    sentenced him to two years of imprisonment, 45 lashes, and a fine of
    twenty million rials for
