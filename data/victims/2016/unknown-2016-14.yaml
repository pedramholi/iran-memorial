    News of the execution of an unknown man, along with seven others, was
    published on the website of Iran Human Rights Organization on January 26,
    2015. According to this report, news of these executions was not reflected
    in the official media. However, the families were informed. Arrest and
    Detention The defendant visited with his family for the last time before
    being executed. There is no specific information on his arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges According to the Iran Human Rights Organization report, the charge
    against the defendant was announced as "related to narcotics." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    the defendant's defense. Judgment This defendant was hanged, along with
    seven others, at the Kerman Prison yard on January 25, 2015.
