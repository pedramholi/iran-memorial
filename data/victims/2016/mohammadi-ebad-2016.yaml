    The execution of Mr. Ebad Mohammad, on April 13, 2016, was reported by
    HRANA News Service. This execution report was confirmed by Boroumand
    Foundation research. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Mohammadi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on this defendant s trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Mohammadi was murder . The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mohammadi s defense. Judgment The court sentenced Mr.
    Mohammadi to death by hanging (retaliation for taking a life). Mr.
    Mohammadi was executed on the morning of Wednesday April 13, 2016, at Raja
    i Shahr Prison, Karaj. The day before his execution, officials at Raja i
    Shahr Prison transferred Mr. Mohammadi to solitary imprisonment.
