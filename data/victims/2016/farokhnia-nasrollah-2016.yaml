    About a year after she had lodged her original complaint, the plaintiff
    submitted an official letter of acquiescence in which she retracted her
    complaint against Mr. Farokhnia and his co-defendants and denied any
    sexual acts having taken place. News of Mr. Nasrollah Farokhnia and his
    co-defendant s execution was published by HRANA News Agency and on the
    Iran Human Rights website (May 31, 2016). Additional information about
    this case was obtained from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center (ABC) with a person with knowledge of the case, an
    electronic form sent to ABC on March 09, 2021, and from evidence and
    documentation obtained by the Center s research. Mr. Nasrollah Farokhnia,
    child of Ali Akbar, was from the city of Chalus. (Documents available at
    the Boroumand Center). Arrest and detention Mr. Farokhnia was arrested in
    the summer of 2008, following a complaint by a woman who claimed he and
    his friends had kidnapped and [sexually] assaulted her. In the afternoon
    of June 18, 2008, on their way from Chalus to [the city of] Noshahr, Mr.
    Farokhnia and two of his friends gave a ride on their motorcycle to a
    student who had asked for their help. The girl had told them that the
    driver of a Peugeot 405 had picked her up as a passenger and had intended
    to rape her on the way. The next day, the girl went to Chalus Police and
    stated that Mr. Farokhnia and his friends had [sexually] assaulted her.
    Mr. Farokhnia spent approximately 6 years in Noshahr Central Prison.
    (Documentation available at the Boroumand Center). Trial Mazandaran
    Province Criminal Court, located in Chalus and composed of a panel of five
    judges, tried Mr. Farokhnia and the other defendants in the case in a
    single session on May 6, 2010. Based on available information, a
    court-appointed attorney was designated for Mr. Farokhnia; however, since
    the plaintiff was not at the trial, the attorney did not have the
    opportunity to question her and mount a defense for the defendant.
    (Documentation available at the Boroumand Center). Charges The court
    declared the charge against Mr. Farokhnia as forcible rape . He was
    accused of kidnapping, rape, and robbery of the plaintiff s money and cell
    phone based on the complaint. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The Plaintiff s testimony
    during preliminary investigations, and the defendant s statements during
    interrogations, questioning by the investigating judge, and in court, were
    used as evidence against Mr. Farokhnia at trial. Furthermore, the Medical
    Examiner s report alluding to injuries suffered by the plaintiff was also
    among the evidence used against him. Based on available documentation, it
    is not clear what the extent of the injuries was, what parts of the
    plaintiff s body were affected, and what caused those injuries.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense Based on available evidence, Mr. Farokhnia and the
    other defendants in the case stated that the plaintiff was present at the
    scene of her own free will. Furthermore, based on the plaintiff s
    statements, available in the case file, she had been brought to the
    location in another vehicle. The defendant was deprived of an attorney in
    the course of the adjudication and was designated a court-appointed
    attorney only in the trial session that resulted in his conviction and the
    issuance of a sentence. Even then, however, the plaintiff was not present
    so that the attorney could question her and thereby be able to defend his
    client. On appeal, the Supreme Court did not heed the defendants attorneys
    request to summon the driver of the automobile that had brought the
    defendant to the scene of the crime, and announced that even if the driver
    could be found and summoned, it would not alter and affect the course [and
    consequences] of the case . On June 18, 2009, that is, about a year after
    she had lodged her original complaint, the plaintiff submitted an official
    letter of acquiescence in which she retracted her complaint against Mr.
    Farokhnia and his co-defendants and denied any sexual acts having taken
    place. According to her statement, Mr. Farokhnia and the other two
    defendants intended to [sexually] assault her but she had been able to run
    away, and they had not been able to harm her, and no sexual acts had ever
    occurred. Because she had been mentally and emotionally harmed, the
    plaintiff stated that she intended to get even and that she had been
    advised that [the best way to that was to lodge a complaint and] the
    complaint was filed for that reason. (Documentation available at the
    Boroumand Center). Given the denial of the occurrence of sexual acts by
