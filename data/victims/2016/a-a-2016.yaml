    News of the execution of Mr. A. A. along with three other individuals* was
    announced by the website of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of
    Gilan Province (January 16, 2016) citing the Public Relations section of
    the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Gilan Province. Mr. A. A. s
    case is related to trafficking illegal drugs. Arrest and detention There
    is no information available on the details of Mr. A. A. s arrest and
    detention. Trial Mr. A. A. was tried by the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Gilan Province. He had a lawyer; however, there is no information
    available on the details of the session or sessions of his trial. Charges
    Mr. A. A. was charged with storing narcotics. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt Possessing 500 grams of heroin as well as 250
    grams of methamphetamine was entered as evidence of guilt against Mr. A.
    A. Defense There is no information available on the details of Mr. A. A. s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Gilan Province
    sentenced Mr. A. A. to death. The verdict was validated by the Chief
    Public Prosecutor as well as the head of the Judiciary. Mr. A. A. was
    hanged along with three other individuals in Rasht Central Prison on
    January 16, 2016. ---------------------------- * H.R. , S.Q. , and M.,F.
