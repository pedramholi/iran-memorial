    The execution of Mr. Rashid Javadi was reported by HRANA News Service on
    December 28, 2016. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Javadi s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Rashidi s trial. It is not known whether he had the right to legal
    representation. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Rashid Javadi was
    transportation and possession of 106 grams heroin . The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Javadi s defense. Judgement The court
    sentenced Mr. Rashid Javadi to death by hanging. A reliable source
    reported that at 6 am, on the day before the execution, Mr. Javadi was
    taken from the public prison to solitary confinement, in advance of his
    execution. At 10 am it was announced that his sentence had been commuted,
    and he was returned to the public section of the prison. Even so, on the
    morning of December 28, 2016, Mr. Javadi was taken back to solitary
    confinement, and at 9:30 am of that same day, he was executed by hanging.
