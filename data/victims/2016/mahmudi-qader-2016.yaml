    News of the execution of Mr. Qader Mahmudi along with seven* other
    individuals was announced by the websites of Human Rights Activists News
    Agency (HRANA) and Center of Democracy and Human Rights in Kurdistan
    (Mafnews) on September 29, 2016. Additional information on this case was
    obtained from the website of Iran Human Rights (September 29, 2016). Mr.
    Mahmudi was a Kurd and he used to live in Dazaj-e Siavosh of Orumieh

    information available on the details of the session or sessions of Mr.
    Mahmudi s trial. Charges Mr. Mahmudi was charged with crimes connected to
    narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no
    information available on the details of the evidence of guilt entered
    against Mr. Mahmudi. Defense There is no information available on the
    details of Mr. Mahmudi s defense. Judgment Mr. Qader Mahmudi was hanged
    along with seven other individuals in Orumieh Central Prison (Darya) on
    the morning of September 29, 2016 (HRANA and Mafnews, September 29, 2016).
