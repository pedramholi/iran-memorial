circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Sanchuli along with two others was
    published on the websites of the Human Rights Activists News Agency (April
    27, 2016) and Edaalatnews (April 28, 2016.) He was only 17 years old when
    arrested. International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment
    against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the
    crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
    Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid
    capital punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Sanchuli s arrest and
    detention are not known except that he was arrested when he was 17 years
    old and he was detained in the Youth Section of Zahedan Central Prison for
    five years. Trial No information is available on Mr. Sanchuli s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Sanchuli was announced as murder.
    No information is available on his charges. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Sanchuli. Defense Mr. Sanchuli was younger than 18 when the incident
    occurred. No information is available on his defense. Judgment Mr.
    Mohammad Sanchuli was hanged, along with two others, at the Zahedan
    Central Prison on April 26, 2016 at 7 a.m. No specific information is
    available about this execution.
