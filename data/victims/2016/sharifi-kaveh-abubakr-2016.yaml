    2016), Kurdistan Human Rights Defenders Center (August 3, 2016), and the
    Amnesty International Report (November 17, 2016). Additional information
    about this execution was obtained through the Boroumand Foundation s
    interview with a person close to Mr. Sharifi, from an Information Ministry
    Announcement (Islamic Republic of Iran Information Ministry website,
    August 3, 2016), Kurdistan Province Judiciary Announcement (Fars New
    Agency, August 2, 2016), from Mr. Sharifi s audio message recorded in
    prison and broadcast on YouTube (August 22, 2016), from Mr. Kaveh Sharifi
    s mother s letter of pain and suffering (Kalemeh World Network, September
    30, 2013), and from other sources.* Mr. Kaveh Sharifi, also known as Abu
    Bakr, child of Towfiq, was single and resided in the [city of] Sanandaj s
    Golshan neighborhood. He was a Sunni Kurd and came from a poor family. In
    addition to teaching religious classes, he sometimes dug water wells in
    order to make ends meet and pay rent. He was a pleasant man with a good
    sense of humor. Based on available information, Kaveh Sharifi had a high
    school diploma with a concentration in architectural drawing. He had
    started his theological education at the age of 14 by participating in
    Abdolhamid Aali s religious classes at the latter s home and at Sanandaj s
    Kani Kuzleh neighborhood mosque. He also went to [the city of] Zahedan
    seminaries to further his religious education. According to an
    acquaintance, Mr. Kaveh Sharifi was a religious man, a follower of the
    Shafe i** branch of Islam, but was not affiliated with any particular
    group or organization. He taught religious subject matters of the Sunni
    faith such as Vajebat ( religious commands ), Hadith ( Prophet s tradition
    ), and Fiqh ( Islamic law ), at his home and at his students homes.
    (Boroumand Foundation interview). Sunni defendants families
    correspondence, including Mr. Sharifi s, with the Leader, the Head of the
    Judiciary, and the President, as well as sit-ins and follow-ups with the
    authorities in protesting the arrest and issuance of a death sentence,
    bore no fruit. According to the Amnesty International report, security
    forces threatened Mr. Sharifi s family and lawyers in order to prevent
    them from releasing information about the cases and to stop them from
    giving interviews to media and human rights organizations. Background
    Based on available information, in the years 2007 to 2009-10, Shi a
    evangelists hurled numerous insults at Sunni beliefs and Sunni respected
    figures, with severe backlash from Sunni religious figures and activists.
    Following famous Shi a movie director Ebrahim Hatamikia s offensive
    statements about Aisha, the Prophet s wife, in Khanevadeye Sabz ( Green
    Family ) Magazine (Volume 195, 2007-08), and statements made by several
    well-known preachers such as Hojjatoleslams Daneshmand, Juybari, and
    Ansari whose speeches were covered by [IRIB,] state radio and television
    in certain instances a number of religious Sunni youth from Kurdistan (who
    considered these insults as being organized) proceeded to hold classes,
    distribute books and CD s in local mosques, universities, and their
    neighborhoods, protesting against these actions and raising awareness, as
    well as promoting and defending the tenets of the Shafe i religion.**
    These CD s contained documented instances of offensive language used
    against Sunni beliefs, quoted from well-known religious sources of the Shi
    a religion such as Bohar-ol-Anvar. The religious activities of these young
    people raised the security apparatus sensitivity. Subsequent to Ayatollah
    Khamenei s trip to Sanandaj in April-May 2009, several young Sunni Kurd
    religious activists were arrested in the name of fighting Salafi and
    Takfiri (term used to denote Sunni extremists such as al-Qaeda and ISIS)
    movements. Three months later, a number of assassinations were carried out
    in Sanandaj, including Mamusta Sheikh-ol-Eslam, member of the Assembly of
    Experts, and Molla Borhan Aali, a Sunni cleric. Security forces accused
    certain individuals of murder, who had been arrested after these
    assassinations. The arrestees denied any connection to armed, extremist,
    or radical groups, objected to the charges brought against them, and asked
    for a new and public trial, to no avail. Ultimately, six of the arrestees
    were executed in December 2012-January 2013, and six others on March 4,
    2015. Also, continuing this process, 25 others, named the Unity and Jihad
    Group , were put to death on August 2, 2016. The issuance and
    implementation of the death penalty for this group of Sunni adherents, was
    followed by the reaction of numerous domestic and internation
