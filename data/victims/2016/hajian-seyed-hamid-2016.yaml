    News of the execution of Mr. Seyed Hamid Hajian along with three other
    individuals* was announced by the website of the Human Rights Activists
    News Agency (HRANA) on January 13, 2016. The case of Mr. Hajian pertains
    to crimes connected to illegal drugs. The judiciary authorities and
    organizations did not post any news items regarding Mr. Hajian s case.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Hajian was transferred to solitary confinement on
    January 10, 2016. However, there is no information available on the
    details of his arrest and detention. Trial There is no information
    available on the details of the session or sessions of Mr. Hajian s trial.
    Charges Mr. Hajian was charged with crimes connected to illegal drugs. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information
    available on the details of the evidence of guilt entered against Mr.
    Hajian. Defense There is no information available on the details of Mr.
    Hajian s defense. Judgment Mr. Seyed Hamid Hajian was hanged, along with
    three other individuals, in Karaj Central Penitentiary Prison, on Tuesday
    January 12, 2016. ------------------------------- * Mohsen Nasiri ,
