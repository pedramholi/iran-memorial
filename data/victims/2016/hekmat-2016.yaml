    Mr. Hekmat, known as Hekmat Araqi , was a Sunni Kurd from Soleimanieh in
    Iraqi Kurdistan. He was a member of the Islamist party Kataeb Navadegan
    Salahuddin Ayyubi in Iranian Kurdistan. (NRT Network, August 5, 2016).
    Kataeb Navadegan Salahuddin Ayyubi After the U.S. and Patriotic Union of
    Iraqi Kurdistan Party s attack in 2003-04 against regions under the
    influence of the Islamist party Ansar al-Islam in the Uramanat regions of
    Iraqi Kurdistan, a number of this party s members fled to Iranian
    Kurdistan. This group had been formed in 2000-01 with the coalition of
    several small Islamist groups. Based on available information, a number of
    Afghan Mujahidin participated in this group, which was also linked with
    al-Qaeda. Ansar-al-Islam was opposed to the influence and power of secular
    groups in Iraqi Kurdistan and demanded a return to the time of Islam s
    inception. The group advocated [the Islamic concept of] forbidding what is
    sinful. Based on available information, Jihad ( Holy War ) against
    secularism and apostasy was this group s priority. A number of previous
    members of the Islamist group Kataeb Fathi , linked with Ansar-al-Islam,
    established a group called Kataeb Kurdistan in Iran. Between 2005 and
    2008, this group conducted several military operations against Patriotic
    Union of Iraqi Kurdistan forces in the Iran-Iraq border region.
    Thereafter, Iran s Information forces arrested several of this group s
    leaders and sentenced them all to 11 years in prison; they were released,
    however, in 2013-14. Some of Kateb Kurdistan s members separated from the
    group in 2007-08 and established the Islamist group Kataeb Navadegan
    Salahuddin Ayyubi which held Jihadi and Salafi beliefs. (Boroumand
    Foundation research). Background Based on available information, in the
    years 2007 to 2009-10, Shi a evangelists hurled numerous insults at Sunni
    beliefs and Sunni respected figures, with severe backlash from Sunni
    religious figures and activists. Following famous Shi a movie director
    Ebrahim Hatamikia s offensive statements about Aisha, the Prophet s wife,
    in Khanevadeye Sabz ( Green Family ) Magazine (Volume 195, 2007-08), and
    statements made by several well-known preachers such as Hojjatoleslams
    Daneshmand, Juybari, and Ansari whose speeches were covered by [IRIB,]
    state radio and television in certain instances a number of religious
    Sunni youth from Kurdistan (who considered these insults as being
    organized) proceeded to hold classes, distribute books and CD s in local
    mosques, universities, and their neighborhoods, protesting against these
    actions and raising awareness, as well as promoting and defending the
    tenets of the Shafe i religion.** These CD s contained documented
    instances of offensive language used against Sunni beliefs, quoted from
    well-known religious sources of the Shi a religion such as Bohar-ol-Anvar.
    The religious activities of these young people raised the security
    apparatus sensitivity. Subsequent to Ayatollah Khamenei s trip to Sanandaj
    in April-May 2009, several young Sunni Kurd religious activists were
    arrested in the name of fighting Salafi and Takfiri (term used to denote
    Sunni extremists such as al-Qaeda and ISIS) movements. Three months later,
    a number of assassinations were carried out in Sanandaj, including Mamusta
    Sheikh-ol-Eslam, member of the Assembly of Experts, and Molla Borhan Aali,
    a Sunni cleric. Security forces accused certain individuals of murder, who
    had already been arrested prior to these assassinations. Security forces
    also accused certain individuals of murder, who had been arrested after
    these assassinations. The arrestees denied any connection to armed,
    extremist, or radical groups, objected to the charges brought against
    them, and asked for a new and public trial, to no avail. Ultimately, six
    of the arrestees were executed in December 2012-January 2013, and six
    others on March 4, 2015. Also, continuing this process, 25 others, named
    the Unity and Jihad Group , were put to death on August 2, 2016. The
    issuance and implementation of the death penalty for this group of Sunni
    adherents, was followed by the reaction of numerous domestic and
    international individuals and organizations. On June 12, 2014, eighteen
