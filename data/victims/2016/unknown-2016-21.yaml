    The execution of this unknown person, on April 13, 2016, was reported by
    HRANA News Service. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on this defendant s trial. Charges The charge brought against
    this unknown person was murder . The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on this person s defense. Judgment The court sentenced this
    unknown person to death by hanging (retribution for taking a life). This
    defendant was executed on the morning of Wednesday, April 13, 2016, in
    Raja i Shahr Prison, Karaj. The day before this execution, officials at
    Raja i Shahr Prison transferred this defendant and several other
    defendants to solitary confinement.
