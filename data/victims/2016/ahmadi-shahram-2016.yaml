    Security agents shot Bahram Ahmadi in the back before arresting him
    without a warrant. News of Mr. Shahram Ahmadi and 24 other individuals
    execution was published by various sources including IRNA (August 3,
    2016), IRIB News Agency (August 3, 2016), Fars News Agency (August 2,
    2016), Khorassan Newspaper (August 4, 2016), HRANA (August 3, 2016),
    Kurdistan Human Rights Defenders Center (August 3, 2016), and the Amnesty
    International Report (November 17, 2016). Additional information about
    this execution was obtained through Boroumand Foundation research and
    interviews with Mr. Ahmadi himself in prison and person with knowledge of
    the case, from an Information Ministry Announcement (Islamic Republic of
    Iran Information Ministry website, August 3, 2016), Kurdistan Province
    Judiciary Announcement (Fars New Agency, August 2, 2016), and from other
    sources.* Mr. Shahram Ahmadi was single and an ethnic Sunni Kurd residing
    in [the city of] Sanandaj. He grew up in a large family and had eight
    siblings. Mr. Ahmadi s father was a laborer. Mr. Ahmadi engaged in
    religious and social activities with the goal of raising people s
    awareness about the government s oppressive and unjust practices. The day
    before his arrest, Mr. Ahmadi gave a fervent speech against the leader of
    the Islamic Republic of Iran s policies at Baharan neighborhood s
    Masjed-onnabi Mosque. (Boroumand Foundation interview and research).
    According to Mr. Shahram Ahmadi, on July 3, 2013, his family was involved
    in a road accident on their way back from visiting him in prison. His
    mother and sister suffered brain injuries. His mother, who had not been
    feeling physically and mentally well after hearing the news of his younger
    son s execution in 2012, lost her memory and one side of her body was
    paralyzed, and his sister lost her speech. According to Mr. Ahmadi, his
    family sold all their assets worth 70 million Tumans in 2009-10 to pay a
    lawyer who claimed he could obtain his and his brother s release; the
    lawyer was not able to do anything and the family s assets were lost.
    (Boroumand Foundation interview with Shahram Ahmadi in jail). Sunni
    defendants families correspondence, including Mr. Ahmadi s, with the
    Leader, the Head of the Judiciary, and the President, as well as sit-ins
    and follow-ups with the authorities in protesting the arrest and issuance
    of a death sentence, bore no fruit. (Boroumand Foundation interview).
    According to the Amnesty International report, security forces threatened
    Sunni prisoners families and lawyers in order to prevent them from
    releasing information about the cases and to stop them from giving
    interviews to media and human rights organizations. Background Based on
    available information, in the years 2007 to 2009-10, Shi a evangelists
    hurled numerous insults at Sunni beliefs and Sunni respected figures, with
    severe backlash from Sunni religious figures and activists. Following
    famous Shi a movie director Ebrahim Hatamikia s offensive statements about
    Aisha, the Prophet s wife, in Khanevadeye Sabz ( Green Family ) Magazine
    (Volume 195, 2007-08), and statements made by several well-known preachers
    such as Hojjatoleslams Daneshmand, Juybari, and Ansari whose speeches were
    covered by [IRIB,] state radio and television in certain instances a
    number of religious Sunni youth from Kurdistan (who considered these
    insults as being organized) proceeded to hold classes, distribute books
    and CD s in local mosques, universities, and their neighborhoods,
    protesting against these actions and raising awareness, as well as
    promoting and defending the tenets of the Shafe i religion.** These CD s
    contained documented instances of offensive language used against Sunni
    beliefs, quoted from well-known religious sources of the Shi a religion
    such as Bohar-ol-Anvar. The religious activities of these young people
    raised the security apparatus sensitivity. Subsequent to Ayatollah
    Khamenei s trip to Sanandaj in April-May 2009, several young Sunni Kurd
    religious activists were arrested in the name of fighting Salafi and
    Takfiri (term used to denote Sunni extremists such as al-Qaeda and ISIS)
    movements. Three months later, a number of assassinations were carried out
    in Sanandaj, including Mamusta Sheikh-ol-Eslam, member of the Assembly of
    Experts, and Molla Borhan Aali, a Sunni cleric. Security forces accused
    certain individuals of murder, who had already been arrested prior to
    these assassinations. The arrestees denied any connection to armed,
    extremist, or radical groups, objected to the charges brought against
    them, and asked for a new and public trial, to no avail. Ultimately, six
    of the arrestees were executed in December 2012-January 2013, and six
    others on March 4, 2015. Also, continuing this process, 25 others, named
    the Unity and Jihad Group , were put to death on August 2, 2016. The
    issuance and implementation of the death penalty for this group of Sunni
    adherents, was followed by the reaction of numerous domestic and
    international individuals and
