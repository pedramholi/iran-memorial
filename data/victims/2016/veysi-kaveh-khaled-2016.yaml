    Mr. Veysi was by the delivery room door awaiting the birth of his only
    child when he was arrested News of Mr. Kaveh Veysi and 24 other
    individuals execution was published by various sources including IRNA
    (August 3, 2016), IRIB News Agency (August 3, 2016), Fars News Agency
    (August 2, 2016), Khorassan Newspaper (August 4, 2016), HRANA (August 3,
    2016), Kurdistan Human Rights Defenders Center (August 3, 2016), and the
    Amnesty International Report (November 17, 2016). Additional information
    about this execution was obtained through Boroumand Foundation s research
    and an interview with a person close to Mr. Veysi, from an Information
    Ministry Announcement (Islamic Republic of Iran Information Ministry
    website, August 3, 2016), Kurdistan Province Judiciary Announcement (Fars
    New Agency, August 2, 2016), and from other sources.* Mr. Kaveh Veysi,
    child of Karim, also known as Mamusta Khaled Mansur Balaghi, was a Sunni
    Kurd from Mansur Balaghi village and resided in [the city of] Sanandaj. He
    was married, had one child (born on the night Mr. Veysi was arrested), and
    lived in a poor neighborhood called Kani Kuzleh in Sananadaj. He worked as
    an errand boy at a clothing store. Mr. Veysi had been entrusted to his
    uncle and aunt as an adopted child and was raised by them in Sanandaj. He
    had a very difficult childhood and would return to the village in the
    spring and summer to do farm work. (Boroumand Foundation interview). Based
    on available documentation, Mr. Veysi started reading the Koran at the age
    of six at their village mosque. In Sanandaj, he went to their neighborhood
    s Jebrael Mosque, and took to learning the Koran, developing oratory
    skills, learning how to preach, and reading religious psychology books. At
    the age of 15, Mr. Veysi met his Arabic teacher Abdolhamid Aali in early
    1998 at Bahr-ol-Olum High School at Sanandaj s Karamuzi neighborhood, and
    started studying theology at Imam Ali Mosque in Sanandaj s Ekbatan
    neighborhood, where that same teacher was the Imam. In pursuing his
    theological studies, and starting at the age of 18, he began living six
    months in [the city of] Zahedan and six months in Sanandaj. Mr. Veysi was
    accepted at Kurdistan University in 2002 as a mathematics student but
    decided not to attend due to financial problems. (Boroumand Foundation
    interview). Mr. Veysi was accepted as a mathematics student at the
    university but did not attend due to poverty According to an acquaintance,
    Mr. Veysi was a religious man, a follower of the Shafe i** branch of
    Islam, but was not affiliated with any particular group or organization,
    and taught religious subject matters of the Sunni faith at his home and at
    his students homes. Mr. Veysi continued to teach the tenets of the Shafe i
    religion even in jail, and answered people s religious inquiries through a
    Telegram channel called Aghideh va Javab ( Belief and Answer ). He was
    taken to the Revolutionary Guards solitary confinement cell for 17 days
    for having this channel. (Boroumand Foundation interview). Sunni
    defendants families correspondence, including Mr. Veysi s, with the
    Leader, the Head of the Judiciary, and the President, as well as sit-ins
    and follow-ups with the authorities in protesting the arrest and issuance
    of a death sentence, bore no fruit. (Boroumand Foundation interview).
    According to the Amnesty International report, Iranian security forces
    threatened Mr. Veysi s family and lawyers in order to prevent them from
    releasing information about the cases and to stop them from giving
    interviews to media and human rights organizations. Background Based on
    available information, in the years 2007 to 2009-10, Shi a evangelists
    hurled numerous insults at Sunni beliefs and Sunni respected figures, with
    severe backlash from Sunni religious figures and activists. Following
    famous Shi a movie director Ebrahim Hatamikia s offensive statements about
    Aisha, the Prophet s wife, in Khanevadeye Sabz ( Green Family ) Magazine
    (Volume 195, 2007-08), and statements made by several well-known preachers
    such as Hojjatoleslams Daneshmand, Juybari, and Ansari whose speeches were
    covered by [IRIB,] state radio and television in certain instances a
    number of religious Sunni youth from Kurdistan (who considered these
    insults as being organized) proceeded to hold classes, distribute books
    and CD s in local mosques, universities, and their neighborhoods,
    protesting against these actions and raising awareness, as well as
    promoting and defending the tenets of the Shafe i religion.** These CD s
    contained documented instances of offensive language used against Sunni
    beliefs, quoted from well-known religious sources of the Shi a religion
    such as Bohar-ol-Anvar. The religious activities of these young people
    raised the security apparatus sensitivity. Subsequent to Ayatollah
    Khamenei s trip to Sanandaj in April-May 2009, several young Sunni Kurd
    religious activists were arrested in the name of fighting Salafi and
    Takfiri (term used to denote Sunni extremists such as al-Qa
