    The execution of Mr. Alireza Sarebani, along with three other people*, on
    April 19, 2016, was reported by HRANA News Service. Mr. Sarebani was a
    native of Orumieh. His case had to do with illegal drugs. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Sarebani s arrest and detention are not
    known. Mr. Sarebani spent five years in prison. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Sarebani s trial. Charges According to available
    information, the charge brought against Mr. Sarebani had to do with
    illegal drugs. However, there is no information on the exact charges
    brought against him. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress . Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Sarebani s defense. Judgment The court sentenced Mr.
    Sarebani to death by hanging. Mr. Sarebani and three other defendants were
    executed in Orumieh Prison, on Tuesday, April 19, 2016.
