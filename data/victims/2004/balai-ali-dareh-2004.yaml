    The news of the execution of Mr. Ali Dareh Bala i and Mr. Zolfali DareH
    Bala i was published on the website of the Keyhan Newspaper on April 30,
    2004. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Ali
    Dareh Bala i s trial. Charges According to the Keyhan Newspaper, the
    charges against the defendants were "rape and stealing cattle." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for various
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence hundreds of
    alleged common criminals to death following judicial processes that fail
    to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution contains no evidence provided against Mr. Ali Dareh Bala i.
    Defense No information is available on his defense. Judgment The court
    condemned these two persons to 80 lashes and death in public. Mr. Ali
    DareH Bala i was hanged, along with the other individual, in the presence
    of their victims families and other onlookers at the entrance of
    Fuladshahr of Najafabad on April 29, 2004 at 6:30 am.
