    News of the execution of Mr. Navab Davudi, along with another person, was
    published on the websites of Esfahan Information on July 18, 2004, ISNA
    (Iranian Students News Agency) on July 19, 2004, and in the Iran newspaper
    on July 20, 2004, quoting the Information Center of Police Headquarters in
    Esfahan. His case and the cases of four others were related to a robbery
    gang named Eblis, in Najafabad, Esfahan, in 2003. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Davudi was identified and arrested by police in Najafabad in September of
    2003 after several women filed complaints (Iran newspaper). The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial A court in
    Esfahan tried Mr. Davudi. No information is available on his trial.
    Charges The charges brought against Mr. Davudi were announced as five
    counts kidnapping, using narcotics, and rape. Pretending to drive a taxi,
    he and four others committed kidnapping and robbery. (Esfahan Information
    website) The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Davudi
    was having a record for three criminal convictions, complaints by four
    women residents of Najafabad, being identified by the face recognition
    system, reports by witnesses, and his own confession. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Davudi s defense. Judgment Mr. Navab
    Davudi was condemned to death, 15 years imprisonment, and 74 lashes.
    Branch Two of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged, along
    with another person, in public at Vilashahr Square in Najafabad on July
    18, 2004. The other defendants of this case were condemned to 15 years
    imprisonment, seven and five years exile to places with harsh
    environments, and 80 lashes.
