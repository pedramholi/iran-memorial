    News and information regarding the execution of Mr. Mehdi Yazdani, son of
    Ali, was sent to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center via an electronic form on
    November 30, 2020 by a person familiar with his case. The news of his
    execution along with the execution of Mr. Navab Davudi , was also
    published on the websites of Esfahan Information on July 18, 2004 and ISNA
    (Iranian Students News Agency) on July 19, 2004, and in the Iran newspaper
    on July 20, 2004, quoting the Information Center of Police Headquarters in
    Esfahan. According to the websites and newspaper, his case and the cases
    of four others were related to a robbery gang named Eblis, in Najafabad,
    Esfahan, in 2003. Mr. Yazdani was born on March 30, 1982. He was single,
    had a highschool diploma and served in the military, artillery barracks
    No. 55 in Esfahan (e-form 11/30/2020). Arrest and detention Mr. Yazdani
    was identified and arrested by police in Najafabad in September of 2003
    after several women filed complaints (Iran newspaper). According to a
    person familiar with this case, the whole case against Mr. Yazdani was
    caused by the fact that at the time of his arrest, Mr. Yazadni and Mr.
    Navab Davudi got into a confrontation with the head of Najafabad s
    intelligence police (e-form 11/30/2020). Following his arrest, Mr.
    Yazadani was tortured for 120 days. (e-form - 01/30/2020). Trial Mr.
    Yazdani was tried by a court in Esfahan. According to a person familiar
    with his case, Mr. Yazdani never actually stood trial, but was
    continuously tortured until he confessed to crimes he had not committed
    (e-form 11/30/2020). Charges The charges brought against Mr. Yazdani were
    announced as five counts kidnapping, using narcotics, and rape. Pretending
    to drive a taxi, he and four others committed kidnapping and robbery.
    (Esfahan Information website). The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to the
    websites and the newspaper, the evidence presented against Mr. Yazdani was
    having a record for two criminal convictions, complaints by four women
    residents of Najafabad, being identified by the face recognition system,
    reports by witnesses, and his own confession. There was no evidence
    against him besides his coerced confession under torture (e-form
    11/30/2020). International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense Based on the information
    provided in an e-form, he did not commit the alleged crimes and the
    charges against him were fabricated; he was in fact at his military base
    at the time the alleged crimes were committed (e-form 11/30/2020). Mr.
    Yazdani did not have access to a lawyer and was not present at his own
    trial (e-form 11/30/2020). Judgment Mr. Mehdi Yazdani was condemned to
    death, 15 years imprisonment, restoring stolen property, paying Dieh

    confirmed the ruling. Mr. Yazdani was hanged, along with another person,
    in public at Vilashahr Square in Najafabad on July 18, 2004. Mr. Yazdani s
    family was informed of his upcoming execution a day in advance (E-formThe
    other defendants of this case were condemned to 15 years imprisonment,
    seven and five years exile to places with harsh environments, and 80
    lashes.
