circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mohammad D., along with two other people, was
    reported in Jomhuri-ye Islami Newspaper and Kayhan Newspaper citing the
    Office of Public Relations of the Ministry of Justice of the Province of
    Kerman (August 21, 2004). His case has to do with armed drug smuggling and
    arms possession. Arrest and detention Mr. Mohammad D. was arrested by the
    Kerman Provincial Police along with another person at his warehouse on
    Abuzar Street in Kerman. The circumstances of Mr. Mohammad D. s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial The Revolutionary Court of Kerman Province
    tried Mr. Mohammad D. No information is available on his trial. Charges
    The charges brought against Mr. Mohammad D. were participation in armed
    drug smuggling, specifically opium and morphine, and possession of arms
    and ammunition . The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The evidence against Mr. Mohammad D. and another suspect was possession of
    3500 kilograms drugs, specifically opium and morphine, 11 Kalashnikov
    rifles, one RPG-7 rocket launcher, four Colt revolvers, one Goryunov
    machine gun, and enough ammunition for all of these weapons .
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mohammad D. s
    defense. Judgment The Revolutionary Court of the city of Kerman sentenced
    Mr. Mohammad D. to death by hanging. This sentence was approved by the
    Supreme Court. On August 19, 2004, he was publicly executed in Haft Bagh
    Square in Kerman, along with two other people.
