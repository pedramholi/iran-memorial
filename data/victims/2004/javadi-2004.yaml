    On January 24, 2004, Mr. Javdi, was fatally shot by law enforcement during
    protests against mass layoffs and unstable working conditions. Information
    regarding the arbitrary execution of Mr. Javadi was gathered from reports
    by the Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA) (January 25 and 26, 2004), a
    special report published by Kolbar News (January 24, 2023), a note
    published on the Balatarin platform (July 10, 2020), an Instagram post by
    the user Pirooz Jam (January 24, 2023), and an analytical report by Kerman
    Khabar (October 15, 2005). Background on the Protest Demonstrations of the
    Workers in the Town of Shahr-e Babak In 2003, in the town of Shahr-e
    Babak, in Kerman Province, Khatoun Abad Copper Project was initiated. This
    project encompassed building a power plant and a copper refinery. They
    were going to build a gas power plant and they were also going to build
    and refurbish facilities for the copper industry. The main outcome was
    production of power and processing copper. In this project, many local
    laborers were hired as contractors. At the end of the building phase and
    the beginning of production, the management proceeded to lay off the
    workers, although many of them had not been paid yet. At that point, the
    workers applied to the Labor Office, the Governor s Office, Social
    Security Organization, and their representatives, all to no avail.
    According to Soheila Jelodarzadeh, member of the time of the Presidium of
    the Islamic Consultative Assembly, after eight months of not having
    received any pay and faced with being laid off, these workers had no
    recourse but to protest. Mr. Karbakhsh, engineer, who was in charge of the
    Kerman Workers Secretariat at the time, has said in this regard, Workers
    Unions do not have enough legal powers. In many countries, unions can
    pursue issues having to do with workers trades, legal matters, and
    employment safeguards. In our country they have very limited powers.
    According to reports, the first protest demonstrations formed in early
    January 2004. Workers staged sit-ins in front of the complex and on roads
    leading to this area. Officials promises to resolve the issues did not
    materialize. On January 18, 2004, the workers and their families gathered
    on the road leading to Khatoun Abad. On the morning of January 23, the
    Special Forces and Police showed up and attacked them. According to
    unofficial sources, at least one person died as a result of this activity.
    The next day, January 24, 2004, the protest demonstrations expanded into
    the town of Shahr-e Babak . Some of the workers and their families
    congregated in front of the Governor s Office. Security forces opened fire
    on them in reaction to this demonstration. As a result, seven people were
    killed, including four workers and a student. Tens of people were injured.
    Official sources announced four people had been killed, but did not name
    them. Mr. Javadi s arbitrary execution According to available information,
    Mr. Javadi was shot by gunfire from military forces on January 24, 2004.
    (Kolbar News, January 24, 2023; Balatarin, July 10, 2020; Instagram post
    by the user Pirouz Jam, January 24, 2023; Kerman Khabar, October 15,
    2005.) No details are available regarding the circumstances of Mr.Javadi s
    killing. Regulations on Controlling Protests There have been numerous
    reports of deaths during critical demonstrations in Iran. In many of these
    cases, armed forces have used firearms to suppress protests. Iranian law
    provides certain regulations regarding the use of firearms by armed forces
    during demonstrations. In addition, there are legal provisions in Iran for
    the punishment of officials who act unlawfully by firing weapons, as well
    as rules for the compensation of victims. This brief overview will review
    these provisions. The law allows armed forces officials to use firearms in
    certain situations, including to prevent riots and disorders. However, the
    law does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes riots and
    disorders. The Law on the Use of Firearms by the Armed Forces in Essential
    Cases, enacted in 1994, outlines specific conditions for the use of
    firearms. The main principle established by this law is that of necessity,
    meaning that armed forces officers may fire their weapons only in
    emergencies. Regarding protests, Articles 4 and 5 of this law allow
    officials to use their weapons under certain conditions to restore order
    and prevent riots. Article 4 states: "Police officers are authorized to
    use firearms to restore order and control illegal demonstrations, suppress
    riots and disorders that cannot be controlled without the use of weapons,
    upon the order of the commander of the operation, if the following
    conditions are met:". a) Other measures must have been tried first and
    proven ineffective. b) There must be a final warning to the rioters and
    insurgents before the use of firearms. Note 1: The determination of riots
    under Article 4 is the responsibility of the heads of the provincial and
    district security council
