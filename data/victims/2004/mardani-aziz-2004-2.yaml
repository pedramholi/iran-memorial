    The news of the execution of Mr. Aziz (or Habib?) Mardani and another
    person was published on the websites of the Keyhan newspaper on both June
    27 and October 14, 2004, as well as the Iran newspaper on June 22, and
    finally the Sharq newspaper on October 14, 2004. According to the Keyhan
    newspaper, a five-year-old boy was missing in the Torkan area of Shiraz in
    February 2004. After the family of the missing boy went to police, his
    body was found nearby in a wilderness area. Arrest and detention According
    to the Keyhan newspaper, after discovering the body, Shiraz police began
    an extensive investigation to identify the perpetrators of the crime. They
    arrested several suspects including two young men. One was named Mojtaba,
    17, and the other 'Aziz, 22. The report does not provide the reason for
    this suspicion. Trial According to the media reports, the defendants were
    tried in Branch 12 of the public court of Shiraz. Charges The Keyhan
    newspaper quotes the Public Prosecutor of Shiraz stating the charges
    against the defendants were "kidnapping, murder, and rape." The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences
    against their political opponents. They are then executed. Each year,
    Iranian authorities sentence hundreds of alleged common criminals to
    death, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence leveled against the
    defendants was their "confessions". According to the Keyhan newspaper,
    these two young men confessed to the murder of the five-year-old boy after
    hours of interrogation. The Sharq newspaper reports that the defendants
    first denied committing the crime. But, after they were transferred to the
    Shiraz Police station, they finally confessed that on his birthday, when
    the boy left his house to buy something, they took him to an animal farm
    nearby pretending to show him a white lamb. But, since he resisted, they
    injured him with broken glass and then beat him in the face. Then, they
    raped him. To avoid being identified, they cut his throat with the glass
    then escaped. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees. They have also questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    Station broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to
    vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs,
    and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to
    the pattern of retracted confessions by the prisoners who have been freed.
    Defense No information is available on the defendant's defense. According
    to the Iran newspaper, they expressed regret for their action. Judgment
    The court condemned these two defendants to death and the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. They were hanged in public in Sharifabad Square of
    Shiraz on October 13, 2004.
