    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Amin, without his last name, along
    with three others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on July
    28, 2004, and in the Iran newspaper on July 29, 2004. His case was related
    to drug trafficking. Arrest and detention According to the existing
    information, after two individuals had been arrested and confessed, Mr.
    Mohammad Amin and three others were arrested. Based on confessions of the
    two arrested individuals, officials staged a smuggling deal and arrested
    the four defendants in Qazvin. The circumstances of their arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court tried Mr. Mohammad Amin and the other defendants. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Mohammad
    Amin and three others were collectively announced as dealing and
    transporting narcotics. (Jomhuri Eslami newspaper) The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Mohammad
    Amin was the confession of two drug traffickers and the official
    investigation. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. Mohammad Amin had an
    attorney; however, no information is available on his defense. Judgment
    Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court condemned Mr. Mohammad Amin
    to death, 40 lashes, and confiscation of his property, except for his
    family s normal living expenses, based on Article 8, Section 6, Article
    16, Section 1, Article 19, and Article 5, Section 1 of the Amendments to
    Drug Law. The General Public Prosecutors Office confirmed the legality of
    the ruling and validated it. He was hanged, along with three others, in
    the presence of the judge of Sentence Enforcement of the Revolutionary
    Public Prosecutors Office in Qazvin, Qazvin Central Prison authorities,
    representatives from forensics, and the Deputy of Drug Combating of the
    Islamic Propaganda Organization at the Qazvin Central Prison yard on July
    27, 2004. The flogging sentence against Mr. Mohammad Amin was carried out
    before his execution.
