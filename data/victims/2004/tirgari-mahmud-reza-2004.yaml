    a jewelry store in Bandar Gaz, killing the owner before they escaped with
    valuables from the store. The police set up road blocks in the vicinity of
    the store in order to find and arrest the criminals. According to the

    police, they started shooting. During the gun fight, two of the robbers
    were killed and a third, named Mahmud, was injured. He was taken to the

    the gang, Mehdi, was found and arrested. Trial According to the Sharq
