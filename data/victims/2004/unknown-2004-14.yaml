    Reports and information regarding the arbitrary execution of an unknown
    individual along with two other citizens of Firuzabad, Fars Province,
    during the protests of February 20, 2004, were obtained from ISNA News
    Agency (February 20 and 23, 2004), the Shooshan website (June 9, 2013),
    and Radio Farda (February 22, 2004). Following the announcement of the
    results of Iran s Seventh Parliamentary Elections on February 20, 2004,
    the city of Firuzabad in Fars Province became the scene of intense clashes
    between protesters and security forces. The demonstrators, who believed
    the announced results were the outcome of electoral fraud, took to the
    streets, setting fire to vehicles belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary
    Guard Corps and police. According to eyewitnesses, the roads leading to
    Shiraz and nearby towns were blocked for a time, and reports emerged that
    some ballot boxes had been entirely recorded in favor of a single
    candidate. The number of casualties varied across local reports: s ome
    reported five deaths, including two women, and 17 injuries, while
    unofficial sources reported the number of victims to be between seven and
    eight . Many of the injured were airlifted to Shiraz due to the severity
    of thier conditions, and many of the protesters were arrested. By the end
    of the following day, the city was completely under government control;
    however, it remained under a tense and repressive security atmosphere.
    (Radio Farda, February 22, 2004) Regulations on Controlling Protests There
    have been numerous reports of deaths during critical demonstrations in
    Iran. In many of these cases, armed forces have used firearms to suppress
    protests. Iranian law provides certain regulations regarding the use of
    firearms by armed forces during demonstrations. In addition, there are
    legal provisions in Iran for the punishment of officials who act
    unlawfully by firing weapons, as well as rules for the compensation of
    victims. This brief overview will review these provisions. The law allows
    armed forces officials to use firearms in certain situations, including to
    prevent riots and disorders. However, the law does not provide a clear
    definition of what constitutes riots and disorders. The Law on the Use of
    Firearms by the Armed Forces in Essential Cases, enacted in 1994, outlines
    specific conditions for the use of firearms. The main principle
    established by this law is that of necessity, meaning that armed forces
    officers may fire their weapons only in emergencies. Regarding protests,
    Articles 4 and 5 of this law allow officials to use their weapons under
    certain conditions to restore order and prevent riots. Article 4 states:
    "Police officers are authorized to use firearms to restore order and
    control illegal demonstrations, suppress riots and disorders that cannot
    be controlled without the use of weapons, upon the order of the commander
    of the operation, if the following conditions are met:". a) Other measures
    must have been tried first and proven ineffective. b) There must be a
    final warning to the rioters and insurgents before the use of firearms.
    Note 1: The determination of riots under Article 4 is the responsibility
    of the heads of the provincial and district security councils. In their
    absence, it is the responsibility of their deputies. If the governor has
    no political deputy, this responsibility is assigned to a member of the
    Security Council. Note 2: In cases where armed forces are assigned the
    task of restoring order and security under this article, they are also
    subject to the provisions of this article regarding the use of firearms.
    This article clearly states that armed personnel must first use non-lethal
    methods and only resort to firearms if those methods fail to control the
    situation. They must also warn the demonstrators. The law does not specify
    what other non-lethal methods should be used, but logically they would
    include things like water cannons, tear gas, and batons. This article
    refers to unarmed protests. For armed demonstrations, Article 5 states:
    "Military and police officers are authorized to use firearms to restore
    order and security during illegal armed demonstrations, riots and armed
    rebellions. Such forces are required to act immediately upon orders of the
    commander to restore order, disarm and collect weapons and ammunition, and
    arrest those to be handed over to the judicial authorities". In all of the
    above situations, officers must first have no alternative but to use their
    firearms. In addition, they must follow the following sequence, if
    possible: a) Warning shots. b) Shots aimed at the lower body. c) Shots
    aimed at the upper body. (Note 3, Article 3) If an officer shoots
    following the above regulations and the victim is not found to be
    innocent, neither the officer nor the officer's organization will be held
    responsible (Article 12). However, if the officer violates these rules,
    shoots without following the rules, and someone is injured or killed as a
    result, the officer may face retaliati
