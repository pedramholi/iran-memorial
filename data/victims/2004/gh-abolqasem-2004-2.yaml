    News of the execution of Mr. Abolqasem Gh. was published in the Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper on May 6, 2004, quoting the Information and Public
    Relations Office of the Khuzestan Courthouse. His case was related to drug
    trafficking. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Abolqasem Gh. s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Khuzestan Courthouse tried
    Mr. Abolqasem Gh. No information is available on his trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Abolqasem Gh. was announced as drug
    trafficking. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Abolqasem Gh. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Abolqasem Gh. s defense. Judgment The Khuzestan
    Courthouse condemned Mr. Abolqasem Gh. to death and the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in public at the Salman Farsi Street
    in Ahvaz in 2004. No specific information is available about this
    execution.
