    News of the execution of Mr. Zare Tajik, son of Abdolghafur, along with
    another defendant, was published in the Ettela at newspaper on May 19,
    2004. He was an Afghan citizen and his case was related to drug
    trafficking. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Tajik s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Iranshahr tried Mr. Tajik. No information is available on his trial.
    Charges The charges brought against Mr. Tajik were announced as importing
    and transporting narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt According to the report, Mr. Tajik and his collaborator had
    trafficked 6 kilograms and 600 grams of heroin into Iranshahr in
    Sistan-va-Baluchistan from Pakistan on November 30, 2002. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Tajik s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Iranshahr condemned Mr. Zare Tajik to death and the
    Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged, along with the other
    defendant, in Iranshahr in 2004. The exact date of this execution is
    unknown.
