    News of the execution of Mr. Farhad Ahmad Mohammad Amin, along with two
    others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on July 1, 2004, and in the
    Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on July 3, 2004. He was an Iraqi Kurdi. His case
    was related to a seven-member gang, named Natasha, that committed armed
    robbery, extortion, rape, and disruption of public order in Iran. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Mohammad Amin and the rest of his gang were arrested by
    the Iranian security forces in Qazvin. The circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Qazvin tried Mr. Mohammad Amin and the other defendants. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against
    Mr. Mohammad Amin and two other defendants were collectively announced as
    armed robbery, extortion, rape, and disruption of public order (Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper). The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Mohammad Amin was participation in several
    robberies. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mohammad Amin s
    defense. Judgment Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qazvin
    condemned Mr. Farhad Ahmad Mohammad Amin to death and the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged, along with two others, in public and
    in the presence of officials in Qazvin on July 1, 2004.
