    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Duzduzani (Seyyed Mehdi
    Kazemi) and 100 other defendants in this case was published by numerous
    sources including Asr-e No (June 3, 2009) and Iran Press (January 4,
    2004). Additional information about this case was obtained from a letter
    written by Mohammad Hadi Massumi published in Buddha weblog (December 7,
    2005) quoting a high-ranking member of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps
    (Revolutionary Guards). Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Duzduzani (Seyyed Mehdi Kazemi)
    was the Revolutionary Guards Army s Deputy for Financial Affairs and one
    of the commanders of the independent Al-Qadir Brigade during the
    eight-year Iran-Iraq war. He was a member of the Jonbesh-e Mottahed-e
    Isargaran ( United Movement of the Self-Sacrificing )*. In early 2001, in
    the presence of Mr. Khamenei (Iranian supreme leader), he protested the
    Revolutionary Guards and the Bassij s Mafia style business practices in
    Europe and the Persian Gulf countries, and the Guards and the Bassij s
    involvement in drug trafficking and the traffic of Iranian women and girls
    to Persian Gulf countries. He stated before the Iranian leader that all of
    Iran s instruments of war were directly and indirectly supplied by the
    United States and Israel, and that overt opposition to America was unwise
    and unreasonable. Mr. Duzduzani also stated that the Iranian regime needed
    to have reasonable relations with the U.S. in order to survive. He said
    that the people should not be deprived of knowing the country s weaknesses
    and limitations and stated that the people were not Namahram ( strangers ,
    those not intimate enough to see or have access to, usually, women and
    their quarters). (Buddha weblog, December 7, 2005). In that same year, Mr.
    Duzduzani wrote an open letter along with a group of veterans and disabled
    veterans, entitled We are warriors , better known as the Commanders of the
    Revolutionary Guards letter, in which he had objected to the policies put
    forth by Iranian leaders including Mr. Khamenei, and to rampant corruption
    and injustice in the country. He further criticized the contradictions
    that existed between what the leaders said and the actions they took, and
    the differences between these deeds and what had been promised at the
    onset of the Iranian Revolution, and added: We have had enough of all the
    discrimination and these contradictions between words and actions Asr-e No
    (June 3, 2009). In the course of a protest sit-in at the Revolutionary
    Guards Joint Headquarters in 2003, where Mr. Duzduzani and tens of
    high-ranking officers were present, he gave a speech and announced the
    establishment of the Jonbesh-e Mottahed-e Isargaran ( United Movement of
    the Self-Sacrificing ). He demanded at the sit-in that Mr. Khamenei come
    amongst the protesters, and stated: If the purpose of the Revolutionary
    Guards is to give its life solely for the survival of these gentlemen
    (alluding to corrupt leaders and their cronies) and their offspring, we
    respectfully kiss our uniforms good bye and put them away. Asr-e No (June
    3, 2009). Furthermore, on the first anniversary of the death of one of the
    Revolutionary Guards commanders, Mr. Duzduzani gave a speech in Tehran s
    Shahid Mahallati neighborhood (reserved for military personnel) and
    disclosed the existence of 147 companies affiliated with the Islamic
    Revolutionary Guards Army that were active in Iran, Dubai, and Europe. He
    alluded to and criticized these companies activities in deriving illegal
    income for organs affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards, such as the
    Revolutionary Guards Information Protection arm and the Revolutionary
    Guards Information Deputy Commander s Office, as well as the Supreme
    Leader Representative s Office within the Revolutionary Guards. He further
    stated that the Revolutionary Guards were now standing in opposition to
    its own initial objectives, the people of Iran, and the honor and
    integrity of the country. Asr-e No (June 3, 2009). According to available
    information, Mr. Duzduzani s case was related to organizing the assembly
    and sit-in by tens of Revolutionary Guards commanders at the Revolutionary
    Guards Joint Headquarters in early 2003 (located at the Qasr-e Firuzeh
    Garrison) where they had demanded Mr. Khamenei attend the assembly and
    answer their questions. Asr-e No (June 3, 2009). Arrest and detention Mr.
    Duzduzani was arrested in early 2003, in the course of an attack on an
    assembly and sit-in of the Jonbesh-e Mottahed-e Isargaran ( United
    Movement of the Self-Sacrificing ) at the Revolutionary Guards Joint
    Headquarters (located at the Qasr-e Firuzeh Garrison), where he and 200
    other participants at the sit-in, all of whom were Revolutionary Guards
    forces, were arrested using tears gas and clubs. Asr-e No (June 3, 2009).
    Trial Tehran Military Tribunal Branch Seven, conducted a closed door trial
    of Mr. Duzduzani and the other defendants in the case. (Asr-e No). the
    court tried Mr. Duzduzani and 200 other defendants in the case in less
    than one week. The
