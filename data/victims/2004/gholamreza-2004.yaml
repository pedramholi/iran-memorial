    News of the execution of Mr. Gholam Reza, without his last name, was
    published in the Ettela at, Iran, and Sharq newspapers on August 12, 2004.
    His case is related to the murder of a person on May 22, 2002. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Gholam Reza was arrested by agents of Police Station 108,
    Navab, in May of 2002. He was transferred to the Criminal Court of Tehran.
    He was detained for 3 years. The circumstances of his arrest and detention
    are not known. (Iran newspaper) Trial Branch 1157 of the Criminal Court of
    Tehran tried Mr. Gholam Reza in several sessions. No information is
    available on his trial. (Iran newspaper) Charges The charge brought
    against Mr. Gholam Reza was announced as murder. During a family fight, he
    had injured his father-in-law by blows of a knife resulting in his death
    in the hospital. (Ettela at and Iran newspapers) The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Gholam Reza was his confession and the
    forensics report indicating his sanity. (Iran newspaper) International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    During his interrogation, Mr. Gholam Reza stated that his father-in-law
    and his brother-in-law came to his house to take his wife on the day of
    the fighting. But because he was against the divorce intention of his
    wife, he resisted and they beat him up. He became angry and attacked them
    with a knife. He claimed to suffer from temporary insanity (Sharq
    newspaper). Mr. Gholam Reza objected to the ruling and his case was
    referred to Branch 27 of the Supreme Court. Judgment Branch 1157 of the
    Criminal Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Gholam Reza to death. Branch 27 of
    the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in the presence of
    the victim s family at the Evin Prison in Tehran on August 11, 2004.
