    He was the Mojtaba sought for questioning in a case in Shiraz in 2004. He
    was 17. The news of the execution of Mr. Mojtaba Amiri and another person
    was published on the websites of the Keyhan newspaper on both June 27 and
    October 14, 2004, as well as the Iran newspaper on June 22, and finally
    the Sharq newspaper on October 14, 2004. According to the Keyhan
    newspaper, a five-year old boy was missing in the Torkan area of Shiraz in
    February, 2004. After the family of the missing boy went to police, his
    body was found in a nearby wilderness area. Mr. Amiri's case was related
    to this incident and he was only 17 years old at the time. International
    laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against those who were
    under the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the
    Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of
    the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an
    offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and detention
    According to the Keyhan newspaper, after discovering the body, Shiraz
    police began an extensive investigation to identify the perpetrators of
    the crime. In this regard, they arrested several suspects including two
    young men. One was named Mojtaba, 17, and the other Aziz, 22. The report
    does not mention the reason for this suspicion. Trial According to the
    media reports, the defendants were tried in Branch 12 of the public court
    of Shiraz. Charges The Keyhan newspaper quotes the Public Prosecutor of
    Shiraz stating the charges against the defendants were "kidnapping,
    murder, and rape." The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    these defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Then they are executed. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence hundreds
    of alleged common criminals to death, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people who have
    been convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The evidence against the two defendants was their "confessions". According
    to the Keyhan newspaper, these two young men confessed to the murder of
    the five-year- old boy after hours of interrogation. The Sharq newspaper
    reports that the defendants first denied committing the crime. But, after
    they were transferred to the Shiraz Police station, they finally confessed
    that on his birthday, when the boy went outside his house to buy
    something, they took him to an animal farm nearby pretending to show him a
    white lamb. But, since he resisted, they injured him with broken glass and
    beat him in the face. Then, they raped him. To avoid being identified,
    they cut his throat with the broken glass and escaped. Defense No
    information is available on the defendant's defense. According to the Iran
    newspaper, they expressed regretted their actions. Judgment The court
    condemned these two defendants to death and the Supreme Court confirmed
    the ruling. They were hanged in public in Sharifabad Square in Shiraz on
    October 13, 2004.
