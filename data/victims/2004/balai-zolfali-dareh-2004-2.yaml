    The news of the execution of Mr. Zolfali Dareاh Bala i and Mr. Ali
    Darebala i was published on the website of the Keyhan Newspaper on April
    30, 2004. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges According to the Keyhan Newspaper, the
    charges against the defendants were "rape and stealing cattle." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for various
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence hundreds of
    alleged common criminals to death following judicial processes that fail
    to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution contains no evidence provided against Mr. Zolfali Dareh
    Bala i. Defense No information is available on his defense. Judgment The
    court condemned Mr. Zolfali Dareh Bala i to 80 lashes and death in public.
    He was hanged, along with the other individual, in the presence of their
    victims families and other bystanders at the entrance of Fuladshahr of
