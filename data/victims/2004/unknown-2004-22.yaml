    News of the execution of an unknown person was reported in Iran Newspaper
    and the News Website of Qazvin Province (September 22, 2004), as well as
    in Jomhuri Eslami Newspaper and Kayhan Newspaper (September 23, 2004). His
    case has to do with the murder of his wife and two daughters on June 13,
    2000. Arrest and detention This unknown person was arrested in June 2000
    after the bodies of a woman and two girls, aged 8 and 12, were discovered.
    The circumstances of this person s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Branch 4 of the Public Court of the town of Takestan tried this
    person. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charge
    brought against this unknown person was killing his wife and two daughters
    . According to available information, on the night of the incident, this
    individual killed his wife following a heated argument by hitting her on
    the head with a beverage bottle. He then killed his daughters by striking
    them with rocks under the Takestan Bridge, and left all the bodies there.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The evidence against this person was listed as: the
    suspect s confession, report of the discovery of the bodies, report of the
    coroner s office, complaint of the victim s parents, and psychiatric
    evaluation of the suspect that showed him to be sane (Iran Newspaper).
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense This unknown person objected to the court ruling,
    and his case was sent to the Supreme Court. However, no information is
    available on his defense. Judgment Branch 4 of the Public Court of
    Takestan sentenced this person to three years prison for murdering his
    daughters based on sections 208 and 220 of the Islamic Penal Code. For
    murdering his wife he was sentenced to death by hanging based on sections
    205, 226, 232, and 233 of the same Code. This sentence was approved by the
    Supreme Court, and the individual was executed in the Central Prison of
    Qazvin on September 21, 2004.
