    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Vakili was reported in Iran
    Newspaper (September 9, 2004) and Shargh Newspaper (September 8, 2004).
    Additional information has been gathered from Kayhan Newspaper and Iran
    Newspaper (January 14, 2001), Ettela at Newspaper (May 1, 2002 and
    September 2, 2004), and Iran Newspaper (September 4, 2004). Mr. Mohammad
    Reza Vakili was a caretaker and his case has to do with the murder of a
    76-year-old attorney and his 80-year-old wife on Wednesday, January 10,
    2001, at Boostan #4 Street, Pasdaran Avenue, Tehran. Arrest and detention
    Mr. Vakili was arrested by detectives from the northeastern division of
    the Tehran Police at his residence in Boom-e-Henn on Thursday, January 11,
    2001. On the day of the incident, a young man called police and reported
    that his elderly parents had been murdered in their own home. Detectives
    were able to ascertain that the last person who had been to their house
    was Mr. Vakili, their caretaker. He spent four years in jail. Trial Branch
    1602 of the Criminal Court of Tehran tried Mr. Vakili. One of the sessions
    took place on April 30, 2002 (Ettele at Newspaper May 1, 2002). No further
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Vakili was murder . According to available information, the suspect s
    motive was to steal money, jewelry, and the victims car, and he killed the
    victims with blows from a large pestle and two-kilogram scale weights. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The evidence against Mr. Vakili was discovery of the
    murder victims bodies, discovery of the suspect in possession of the
    stolen goods and car, and also his confession (Iran Newspaper September 4,
    2004). International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned
    the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense Mr. Vakili stated in court that two other people had
    committed these murders. He said he feared them and so had confessed to
    these crimes (Ettela at Newspaper May 1, 2002). He also objected to the
    sentence, but no information is available on his defense. Judgment Branch
    1602 of the Criminal Court of Tehran handed down two sentences of
    execution by hanging to Mr. Vakili. The death sentence for murdering the
    attorney was approved by Branch 20 of the Supreme Court, but the sentence
    concerning his wife was sent to the Public Court for reconsideration. Mr.
    Vakili was executed at Evin Prison on September 8, 2004.
