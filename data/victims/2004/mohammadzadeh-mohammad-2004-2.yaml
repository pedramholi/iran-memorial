    The news of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Mohammadzadeh was published on
    the websites of both the Sharq and the Jomhuri Eslami newspapers on
    January 26, 2004. According to the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper, "Mohammad
    Mohammadzadeh, at the age of 17, murdered a 65-year-old man named Musa
    Azadi." International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment
    against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the
    crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
    Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid
    capital punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges The deputy Public Prosecutor of Ilam announced
    the charge against the defendant as "murdering a 65 years old man in
    1999." Evidence of guilt The evidence provided against the defendant was
    his confession to the murder due to sexual issues. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the
    case of political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised.
    The National Television Station broadcasts confessions during which
    prisoners plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce
    their political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights
    organizations have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by
    those prisoners who have been freed. Defense In his defense, the defendant
    claimed "sexual issues" as his motivation for the murder. Judgment The
    court condemned Mr. Mohammad Mohammadzadeh to death and the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in Ilam prison on January 25, 2004.
