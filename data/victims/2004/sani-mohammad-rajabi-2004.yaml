    Mohammad Rajabi Sani paid a heavy price serving his country in the
    Iran-Iraq war. The state rewarded his sacrifice with poverty and death.
    News of the death of Mr. Mohammad Rajabi Sani was published by Mehr News
    Agency on November 20, 2004. Additional information was gathered from the
    Mehr News Agency on December 3, 2004; the Sharif News website on December
    5, 15, 2004, January 4, 2005, and April 4, 2006; the newspaper Iran on
    December 30, 2004; the newspaper Hamshahri on January 5, and April 21,
    2005; the newspaper Kayhan on July 27, 2005; and from the website of
    Shahid Avini on November 28, 2004. Mr. Mohammad Rajabi Sani, son of Safar
    ali, was born in Tehran on January 10, 1965. He was married with two
    children. When he was 13 years old, he first lost his father and then his
    mother shortly after. He went to the front of the Iran-Iraq war as a
    volunteer when he was 17 years old, and then remained at the front as a
    conscript in the army. Mr. Rajabi Sani was a veteran with 35 percent
    neurological and psychiatric disability covered by the Islamic
    Revolutionary Veterans Foundation. His life was characterized by poverty
    and hardship and he made a living by driving passengers in the city. Mr.
    Rajabi Sani had been injured several times during the war. The first time,
    he temporarily lost his ability to speak due to an explosion shock wave.
    Later on, the explosion of an aircraft rocket lodged shrapnel inside his
    shoulder and arm. After a successful operation, he was sent back to the
    front and injured by a truck explosion during an ammunition run to an area
    under siege. His psychological health faltered after this incident.
    According to existing information, Mr. Rajabi Sani suffered from psychotic
    breaks and was hospitalized at mental hospitals many times. According to
    his family, his psychological health worsened with every hospitalization.
    For over 11 years, he consumed a daily dosage of more than 25 pills for
    his neurological and psychological illness (Hamshahri newspaper, January
    5, 2005). The case of Mr. Rajabi Sani related to a complaint by two
    brothers regarding the breaking of their cars windows following a fight in
    a local supermarket. This incident occurred about one and a half months
    before his death. According to the existing information, Mr. Rajabi Sani
    was shopping when the two brothers, both residents of Sani s neighborhood,
    mocked him. During the course of an altercation, Mr. Rajabi Sani lost his
    temper and smashed the windows of their cars (Hamshahri newspaper, January
    5, 2005; Shahid Avini on November 28, 2004). Media reports regarding Mr.
    Rajabi Sani s case resulted in several statements and follow-up from
    authorities. Arrest and detention Following a complaint filed by a private
    plaintiff, agents of Police Station 128 in Niru-Hava i District arrested
    Mr. Rajabi Sani and transferred him to the station s detention center. One
    week later, on September 29, 2004, his case was sent to Branch Two of
    Resalat Court in Tehran where he was interrogated by Mr. Karimian (the
    investigating judge) without the presence of an attorney. The
    investigating judge set bail for Mr. Rajabi Sani in the amount of 100
    million Rials (around 3,000 USD). His family could not afford the bail and
    the investigating judge ordered his transfer to the police station
    detention center. Mr. Rajabi Sani was sent on to Evin Prison and, one day
    later, to Qezelhesar Prison. Mr. Rajabi Sani s wife reported that on the
    day of the investigation she had reminded Karimian that her husband
    suffered from psychological breakowns and would face trouble if unable to
    take his medicine. However, the investigating judge ignored Rajabi Sani s
    medical history. Mr. Rajabi Sani s family visited him in prison three
    times. Their fourth attempt to visit him was not allowed. During his
    detention period, Mr. Rajabi Sani s family warned the authorities about
    his psychological problems several times. According to them, he had access
    to his medications while detained at the police station detention center,
    though he was denied medical attention in prison and his health
    deteriorated and his behavior became abnormal without access to his pills.
    Mr. Rajabi Sani s wife reported that during her first visitation six days
    after his transfer to Qezelhesar Prison, Mr. Rajabi Sani s hands were
    trembling and his speech was unbalanced. She described his health as
    horrible during the third visitation and stated: His whole body was
    trembling and he could not speak properly. I asked him if he took his
    pills and he replied: No, they don t give me any pills here and I want to
    see the prison s physician (Mehr news agency on November 20, 2004).
    According to existing information, Mr. Rajabi Sani s wife visited him
    three times on October 5, 9, and 16, 2004. She had warned the prison
    authorities regarding her husband s psychological health and his daily
    need for pills several times. Prison officials refused to dispense the
    medicine without a judge s order, however (Hamshahri newspaper
