    News of the execution of Mr. Bahman, without his last name, along with
    three others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on July 28,
    2004, and in the Iran newspaper on July 29, 2004. His case was related to
    drug trafficking. Arrest and detention According to the existing
    information, after two individuals had been arrested and confessed, Mr.
    Bahman and three others were arrested. Based on confessions of the two
    arrested individuals, officials staged a smuggling deal and arrested the
    four defendants in Qazvin. The circumstances of their arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court tried
    Mr. Bahman and the other defendants. No information is available on his
    trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Bahman and three others
    were collectively announced as dealing and transporting narcotics.
    (Jomhuri Eslami newspaper) The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Bahman was the confession of two
    drug traffickers and the official investigation. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    Mr. Bahman had an attorney; however, no information is available on his
    defense. Judgment Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court condemned
    Mr. Bahman to death and confiscation of his property, except for his
    family s normal living expenses, based on Article 8, Section 6, Article
    16, Section 1, Article 19, and Article 5, Section 1 of the Amendments to
    Drug Law. The General Public Prosecutors Office confirmed the legality of
    the ruling and validated it. He was hanged, along with three others, in
    the presence of the judge of Sentence Enforcement of the Revolutionary
    Public Prosecutors Office in Qazvin, Qazvin Central Prison authorities,
    representatives from forensics, and the Deputy of Drug Combating of the
    Islamic Propaganda Organization at the Qazvin Central Prison yard on July
    27, 2004.
