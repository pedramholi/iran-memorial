circumstances: >
    The news of the execution of an unknown person was published on the
    website of the Keyhan newspapers on May 26, 2004. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    According to the media report, the charge against the defendant was “drug
    trafficker.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and then
    executed them citing drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence hundreds of alleged
    common criminals to death, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense.
    Judgment The court condemned this person to death and the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in public and the presence of some
    officials in Ahvaz.
