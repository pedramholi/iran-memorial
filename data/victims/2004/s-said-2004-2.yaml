    News of the execution of Mr. Sa id S. was published in the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper on March 16, 2004, quoting the Public Relations Office of the
    Khuzestan Courthouse. His case is related to the murder of an individual.
    Arrest and detention The Intelligence Police agents of the Seviseh Station
    in Ahvaz arrested Mr. Sa id S. The circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Mr. Sa id S. was tried in the Khuzestan
    province. No information is available on his trial. Charges According to
    the Public Relations Office of the Khuzestan Courthouse, the charge
    brought against Mr. Sa id S. was announced as murder. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Sa id S. was testimony of the victim s parents,
    recovery of the body by fishermen, and his confession. After fighting with
    his brother-in-law, he hit him on the head with an iron bar resulting in
    his death. Then he buried the body in the garden of his house. But because
    of the stench, he covered the body in a cloth and threw it into the Karun
    River after two days. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Sa id S. s defense. Judgment A court condemned Mr. Sa id S. to death
    and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was executed at the Ahvaz
    Prison yard on March 15, 2004 at 7 a.m.
