    News of the execution of Mr. Mehzyar was published on the website of
    Khorasan newspaper on January 29, 2004. Additional information was taken
    from the Khorasan newspaper on April 24, 2003. According to the existing
    information, he was 21 years old and his case was related to the
    kidnapping and murder of Mr. Mohammad Amin, age 14, in Tehran on March 9,
    2003. Arrest and detention Following the kidnapping of Mr. Mohammad Amin
    and several phone contacts by the kidnappers with his family in order to
    extort money for his release, police detectives of Department 11 in Tehran
    identified and arrested Mr. Mehzyar and another defendant in a house at
    Iranshahr Street in Tehran (Khorasan newspaper on April 24, 2003). The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 1601
    of the General Court in Tehran tried Mr. Mehzyar and another defendant,
    out of turn and extraordinarily. No specific information is available on
    his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Mehzyar were announced
    as kidnapping and murder. He was accused of kidnapping Mr. Mohammad Amin,
    in collaboration with another defendant, and demanded 600 million Tumans
    for his release, but suffocated him with a rope. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    According to the existing information, the bases for Mr. Mehzyar s
    conviction was his confession. International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense According to the existing
    information, the legal procedure of Mr. Mehzyar s case had been rushed and
    out of turn. No information is available on his defense. Judgment Based on
    a request by the victim s family, Branch 1601 of the General Court in
    Tehran condemned Mr. Mehzyar to death as the first row defendant (Khorasan
    newspaper on April 24, 2003). The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He
    was hanged on January 29, 2004 at dawn. No specific information is
    available about this execution. The other defendant of this case was
    condemned to 30 years imprisonment and lashes for kidnapping and
    participation in murder.
