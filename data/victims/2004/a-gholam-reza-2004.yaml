    News of the execution of Mr. Gholam Reza A., alias Hossein Nasaki, along
    with two other people, was reported in Jomhuri-ye Islami Newspaper citing
    the Public Relations Office of the Ministry of Justice of the Province of
    Kerman (September 21, 2004). His case has to do with drug smuggling and
    threatening public security in the area of Golbaf and Kerman. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Gholam Reza A. was arrested in 2002. According to the
    report, he was arrested after two altercations and evading police in the
    area of Golbaf and Kerman. He spent three years in jail. However, the
    details of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Revolutionary
    Court of Kerman tried Mr. Gholam Reza A. No information is available on
    his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Gholam Reza A. were
    smuggling drugs, arms, alcoholic beverages, and threatening public
    security in the area of Golbaf and Kerman . The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence providedagainst the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Gholam Reza A. s defense. Judgment The
    Revolutionary Court of Kerman sentenced Mr. Gholam Reza A. to death by
    hanging. This sentence was approved by the Supreme Court. He was executed,
    along with two other people, on August 19, 2004. The public hanging took
    place at the Haft Bagh Square in Kerman.
