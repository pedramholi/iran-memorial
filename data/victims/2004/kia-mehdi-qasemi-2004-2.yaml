    a jewelry store in Bandar Gaz, killing the owner before they escaped with
    valuables from the store. The police set up road blocks in the vicinity of
    the store in order to find and arrest the criminals. According to the

    police, they started shooting. During the gun fight, two of the robbers
    were killed and a third, named Mahmud, was injured. He was taken to the
    hospital and survived. After a few days of searching, a fourth member of
    the gang, Mehdi, was found and arrested. Trial According to the Sharq

    store, then shot and killed the owner, Abdollah Mas'udi. Then, they took 7
    kilograms gold, 133 Bank notes, and 19 checks and escaped by car."
