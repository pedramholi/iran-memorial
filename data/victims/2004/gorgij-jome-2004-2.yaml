    News of the execution of Mr. Jome Gorgij, son of Mohammad Gol, was
    announced by various outlets including the website of Kayhan daily
    (December 7, 2004), Islamic Republic daily (December 11, 2004), Iran daily
    (December 9, 2004), and Ettela at daily (December 11, 2004). According to
    the available information, the case of Mr. Gorgij pertains to membership
    in a drug cartel, as well as armed purchase and sale of illegal drugs.
    Arrest and detention According to the available information, Mr. Gorgij
    was arrested by the police force of Sistan and Baluchistan Province
    (Islamic Republic daily). However, there is no information available on
    the details of his arrest and detention. Trial According to the available
    information, Mr. Gorgij and the other defendants of this case were tried
    by Branch 1 and Branch 2 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Zahedan
    (Islamic Republic daily). However, there is no information available on
    the details of the session or sessions of Mr. Gorgij trial. Charges
    According to the available documents, Mr. Gorgij and the other defendants
    of this case were collectively charged with establishing and membership in
    a drug cartel with the purpose of obtaining and distributing illegal drugs
    in the cities of Qom, Kerman and Tehran. Mr. Gorgij and the other executed
    defendants were charged with carrying, storing and distributing heroin,
    opium and hashish, as well as membership in fear-inducing cartels (Kayhan
    daily). Possessing firearms, and armed struggle with the police force that
    led to the death of a police agent, were among other charges brought
    against the defendants of this case (Ettela at daily). The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information available on the
    details of the evidence of guilt entered against Mr. Gorgij. Defense There
    is no information available on the details of Mr. Gorgij s defense.
    Judgment Branch 1 and Branch 2 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Zahedan sentenced Mr. Jom e Gorgij to death. The verdict was validated by
    the Supreme Court. After the Chief Public Prosecutor had enforced the
    sentence (Islamic Republic daily), Mr. Gorgij and the other six
    defendants* of this case were publicly hanged in the Laleh Park of
    Zahedan, at the juncture between Behesht and Janbazan Boulevards, at 10 AM
    on Tuesday, December 7, 2004. ------------------------ * Abdolmajid
