    News of the execution of Mr. Majid, without his last name, was published
    in the Iran newspaper on August 4, 2004. His case was related to
    possession and selling narcotics. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Majid s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch Two of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court in Qazvin tried Mr. Majid. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Majid were
    announced as possession and selling narcotics and addiction. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Majid was his confession. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Majid s defense. Judgment Branch Two of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court in Qazvin condemned Mr. Majid to death and
    confiscation of his property for possession and selling narcotics, and to
    paying one million Rials fine, and 20 lashes for his addiction to opium.
    He was hanged in Qazvin in 2004. No specific information is available
    about this execution.
