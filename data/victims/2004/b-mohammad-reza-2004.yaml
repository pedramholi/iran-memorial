    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza B.(known as Mohammad Siah), was
    announced in the website of the Kayhan newspaper on January 1, 2005 as
    well as the website of the Iran newspaper on January 18. Arrest and
    detention According to Iran , in the spring of 2003, a few residents of
    the Hedayat Boulevard in Mashhad filed a complaint with the judiciary
    against a young man who caused insecurity and fear in the neighborhood.
    The suspect was identified as a seditious man with criminal record and
    after some time a group of officers, identified his hiding place in a
    village near Mashhad and, after some clashes, arrested him. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial other than he was tried
    at Branch 63 of the Public Court of Mashhad ( Iran newspaper). Charges Mr.
    Mohammad Reza B. was charged with sedition and harassment, intimidation
    and causing disturbance, battery and assault, consumption of alcohol,
    resistance against [law enforcement] officers, and raping of two
    adolescent boys. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution states Mr.
    Mohammad Reza had confessed to rape and that after his confession, two of
    the adolescents, whom he had raped, were identified by law enforcement
    officers and these [boys] also filed a complaint against him at the court.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. In the case of political detainees, these confessions are,
    at times, televised. The National Television broadcasts confessions during
    which prisoners plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and
    renounce their political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights
    organizations have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by
    those prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available on his
    defense. Judgment Branch 63 of the Public Court of Mashhad condemned Mr.
    Mohammadreza B. to execution in public, 9 years imprisonment, and 154
    lashes and this ruling was approved by the Supreme Court ( Iran
    newspaper). The verdict was carried out and he was hanged at Hedayat
    Boulevard in Mashhad ( Kayhan newspaper).
