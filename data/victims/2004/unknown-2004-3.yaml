    News of the execution of an unknown individual, along with another person,
    was published in the Ettela at newspaper on October 12, 2004. This case
    was related to drug charges. The defendant had a criminal record. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of the defendant s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Hamadan tried the
    defendant. No information is available on the unknown person s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against the unknown person was announced as
    possession of 105 grams of heroin. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against the unknown person. Defense
    No information is available on the unknown person s defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Hamadan condemned this unknown person to
    death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. This person was hanged,
    along with the other defendant, in Hamadan in 2004. The exact date of the
    execution is unknown.
