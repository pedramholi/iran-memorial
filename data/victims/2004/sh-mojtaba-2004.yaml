    News of the execution of Mr. Mojtaba Sh. was announced by the website of
    Hamshahri daily on November 24, 2004. He was 33, and from Semirom.
    According to the available information, the case of Mr. Mojtaba Sh.
    pertains to the death of his maternal cousin in an ongoing mass struggle
    in the Semirom City of Isfahan Province in 2000. Arrest and detention
    According to the available information, the police force arrested Mr.
    Mojtaba Sh. forty days after the incident that led to the death of his
    maternal cousin. Upon hearing about the death of his cousin, Mr. Mojtaba
    Sh. first went to Shahreza, then to Isfahan, and eventually to Tehran. He
    spent four years in prison after he was arrested. However, there is no
    information available on the details of Mr. Mojtaba Sh. s arrest and
    detention. Trial According to the available information, the judge of
    Branch Two of the Public Court of Semirom, of Isfahan Province, tried Mr.
    Mojtaba Sh. However, there is no information available on the details of
    the session or sessions of his trial. Charges The court charged Mr.
    Mojtaba Sh. with murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offenses, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to the available information, the knife with which the victim
    had been stabbed was entered as evidence of guilt against Mr. Mojtaba Sh.
    In addition, his own confessions were used as evidence of guilt against
    Mr. Mojtaba Sh. Defense According to the available information, the mass
    struggle had started a few days before the incident. In addition to Mr.
    Mojtaba Sh., there were a few others present when Mr. Mojtaba Sh. s cousin
    was injured. The victim was stabbed during the fight. He was moved to the
    Imam Khomeini Hospital of Semirom, but since the hospital could not
    provide the necessary medical equipment for his treatment, the victim was
    moved to Shahreza County, 82 kilometers away from Semirom. The victim died
    on the way. According to the available information, Mr. Mojtaba Sh. only
    confessed to having had a quarrel with his cousin over the possession of a
    tract of land. However, there is no further information available on the
    details of Mr. Mojtaba Sh. s defense. Judgment Branch Two of the Public
    Court of Semirom, with reference to the articles 206, 207, 231, 232, 233,
    and 257 of the Islamic Criminal Code, as well as at the request of the
    first-degree blood relatives of the victim, sentenced Mr. Mojtaba Sh. to
    death as religious retaliation. Mr. Mojtaba Sh. was publicly hanged in the
    presence of the people of Semirom, and the first-degree blood relatives of
    the victim, on the morning of November 23, 2004. Mr. Mojtaba Sh. s
    maternal uncle personally put the noose around the neck of his nephew.
