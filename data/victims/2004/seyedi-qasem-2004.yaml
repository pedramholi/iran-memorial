    The news of the execution of Mr. Qasem Seyedi (Seyed Hashem) was published
    in the Etela'at and the Iran newspapers as well as the websites of the
    Keyhan on October 5, and the Sharq on October 13, 2004. Arrest and
    detention According to the Keyhan newspaper report, a full week after the
    murder was committed, no one knew about it. Then, one of the victim's
    relatives went to his house, discovered the body and informed the police.
    The police investigation began with relatives of the victim. Qasem Seyedi
    was a relative and did not participate in the victims' mourning, so the
    police suspected him. He quickly left town, but in short order the police
    found and arrested him. Trial This defendant s trial was held in Mashhad
    Branch 53. Based on the media reports, it is unknown if the case was
    referred to a higher court. Charges The charges against the defendant were
    announced as "murdering four members of a family on March 15, 2004."
    According to the Keyhan newspaper report, Qasem Seyedi (also known as
    Seyed Hashem) went to the house of his relative named Jalal 'Alameh in
    order to cash a 200 thousand Tomans (about $220) check. The victim's wife
    and two children were present, but quickly left the house. After their
    exit, an argument broke out between the victim and the defendant. The
    defendant killed the victim with a kitchen knife and when the wife and
    children came back home, he killed them as well. Then he turned on the gas
    and escaped. Evidence of guilt According to the media report, the
    defendant confessed to the murder. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the case of
    political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised. The
    National Television Station broadcasts confessions during which prisoners
    plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their
    political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations
    have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those
    prisoners who have been freed. Defense According to the Etela'at newspaper
    report, the defendant said he went to the victim s house to retrieve a
    check. When the victim refused to return the check, the defendant killed
    him with the kitchen knife. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Qasem Seyedi
    to four counts of Qesas (death sentence). The ruling was executed in the
    presence of the victim's family as well as other onlookers in Madar Square
    of Mashhad on October 12, 2004.
