    The execution of Mr. Parviz Khaleqi was reported in E temad Newspaper,
    Kayhan Newspaper, and Iran Newspaper (August 26, 2004) as well as Iran
    Newspaper (September 9, 2004). He was executed with another person
    according to the Prison Administration Site and Kayhan Newspaper
    (September 11, 2004). Additional information has been gathered from Iran
    Newspaper (September 9, 2003). Mr. Khaleqi was married and had a child.
    His case has to do with forming a gang with four other people and
    committing kidnapping, rape, assault, and verbal abuse against several
    women and young girls in 2002. Arrest and detention Mr. Khaleqi was
    arrested along with two other people on October 17, 2002, in Mohammad
    Shahr, Karaj. These three people had been under surveillance since July 6,
    2002, the reason being that a family had filed a complaint about their
    daughter, who had been abducted and subjected to assault and verbal abuse
    by these men. The chief of police of Karaj organized several groups of
    detectives to track down this gang. After staking out several locations in
    Karaj, the officials found the red car with three men and a female
    passenger. After they were arrested, the judge at Branch 119 of the
    Criminal Court of Karaj ordered their pictures to be printed in the
    newspapers. As a result, several girls and young women went to the police
    station, identified the accused, and reported that these people had abused
    them. After the three men confessed, two other accomplices were also
    arrested. The group spent two years in prison. Trial Branch 45 of the
    Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office of Karaj tried Mr. Khaleghi
    and the other suspects. This trial went on for several sessions. There is
    no information available regarding the proceedings. Charges The charges
    brought against Mr. Khaleqi, the main defendant, were rape, kidnapping,
    and robbery with physical abuse (Kayhan Newspaper). The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence against Mr. Khaleqi was reported to be confessions of the
    accused, complaints of the victims, identification of the accused by the
    victims, publishing their pictures for the public, and finding stolen gold
    jewelry . In the preliminary phases of questioning, these men denied
    having any part in kidnapping and assaulting women. However, after being
    confronted by the victims, they confessed. According to their confessions,
    they would wait for young women who needed transportation. Once they young
    women were in the car, they would threaten them with knives, take them to
    deserted areas, steal their money and jewelry, rape them, and abandon
    them. International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned
    the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense No information is available on Mr. Khaleghi s
    defense. Judgment Branch 119 of the Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor s
    Office of Karaj gave the following judgement: Mr. Khaleghi was condemned
    to death by hanging for rape, 25 years imprisonment and 70 lashes for
    kidnapping and five counts of robbery and aggravated assault. This
    judgement was approved by the Supreme Court. Mr. Khaleghi was executed in
    public view, on Hessarak street in Karaj, by hanging from a crane on the
    morning of August 25, 2004. The second defendant, Mr. Ghasem Aghsami, was
    condemned to death by public hanging, 23 years prison, and 60 lashes. The
    third defendant, Mr. Hasan Hasanvand, was condemned to death by public
    hanging for assault and battery of women and young girls, 15 years prison
    for kidnapping and four counts of robbery with aggravated assault, and 50
    lashes. The fourth defendant was condemned to 99 lashes in public view and
    five years prison in a distant, unpleasant area for illicit relations, and
    16 years prison and 50 lashes for kidnapping and two counts of robbery
    with assault. The fifth defendant was condemned to one year of prison and
    30 lashes for one count of kidnapping and robbery with assault.
