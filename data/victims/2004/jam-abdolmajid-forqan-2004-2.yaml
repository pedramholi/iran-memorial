    News of the execution of Mr. Abdolmajid Forqan Jam, son of Abdolhamid, was
    announced by various outlets including the website of Kayhan daily
    (December 7, 2004), Islamic Republic daily (December 11, 2004), Iran daily
    (December 9, 2004), and Ettela at daily (December 11, 2004). According to
    the available information, the case of Mr. Forqan Jam pertains to
    membership in a drug cartel, as well as armed purchase and sale of illegal
    drugs. Arrest and detention According to the available information, Mr.
    Forqan Jam was arrested by the police force of Sistan and Baluchistan
    Province (Islamic Republic daily). However, there is no information
    available on the details of his arrest and detention. Trial According to
    the available information, Mr. Forqan Jam and the other defendants of this
    case were tried by Branch 1 and Branch 2 of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Zahedan (Islamic Republic daily). However, there is no
    information available on the details of the session or sessions of Mr.
    Forqan Jam trial. Charges According to the available documents, Mr. Forqan
    Jam and the other defendants of this case were collectively charged with
    establishing and membership in a drug cartel with the purpose of obtaining
    and distributing illegal drugs in the cities of Qom, Kerman and Tehran.
    Mr. Forqan Jam and the other executed defendants were charged with
    carrying, storing and distributing heroin, opium and hashish, as well as
    membership in fear-inducing cartels (Kayhan daily). Possessing firearms,
    and armed struggle with the police force that led to the death of a police
    agent, were among other charges brought against the defendants of this
    case (Ettela at daily). The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt There is no information available on the details of the evidence of
    guilt entered against Mr. Forqan Jam. Defense There is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Forqan Jam s defense. Judgment Branch 1
    and Branch 2 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Zahedan sentenced Mr.
    Abdolmajid Forqan Jam to death. The verdict was validated by the Supreme
    Court. After the Chief Public Prosecutor had enforced the sentence
    (Islamic Republic daily), Mr. Forqan Jam and the other six defendants* of
    this case were publicly hanged in the Laleh Park of Zahedan, at the
    juncture between Behesht and Janbazan Boulevards, at 10 AM on Tuesday,
    December 7, 2004. ------------------------ * Mohammad Ghos Hassanzehi, Zia
