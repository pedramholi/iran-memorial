    News of the execution of Mr. Abdollah D. was published in the Kayhan
    newspaper on January 13, 2004, quoting the Information and Public
    Relations Office of the Khuzestan Courthouse, and in the Sharq newspaper
    on January 22, 2004. His case was related to drug trafficking. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Abdollah D. s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Mahshahr
    tried Mr. Abdollah D. No information is available on his trial. Charges
    The charge brought against Mr. Abdollah D. was announced as drug
    trafficking. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Abdollah D. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Abdollah D. s defense. Judgment Branch One of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Mahshahr condemned Mr. Abdollah D. to death and the
    Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in public and in the
    presence of authorities at the Shahid Bandar (Chaharshir) Square in Ahvaz
    in January of 2004. No specific information is available about this
    execution.
