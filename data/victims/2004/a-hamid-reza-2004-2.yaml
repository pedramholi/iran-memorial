    News of the execution of Mr. Hamid Reza A., along with another person, was
    published in the Kayhan newspaper on January 4, 2004, quoting the Head of
    Political and Ideological Police Commander in Gonabad. He was from
    Mashhad, where he resided, and his case was related to drug trafficking.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Hamid Reza A. was arrested in 2001. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial Mr. Hamid
    Reza A. was tried in Gonabad. No information is available on his trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Hamid Reza A. was announced as
    transportation of narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Hamid Reza A. was announced as
    possession of 38 kilograms of heroin and 10 kilograms of opium. The same
    evidence was used against the other defendant, who was arrested a year
    later. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hamid Reza A. s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Hamid Reza A. was condemned to death and the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged, along with another person, in Gonabad
    in early 2004. No specific information is available about the defendant s
    execution.
