    News of the execution of a person named as R. T. was published on the
    websites of Kayhan newspaper on April 5, 2004, and Ettela at newspaper on
    April 4, 2004. This person was from the Qushchi Village near Orumieh and
    resided in Orumieh (Ettela at newspaper). According to the existing
    information, his/her case was related to narcotics. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of R. T. s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz tried R. T. No
    information is available on the trial. Charges The charge brought against
    R. T. was announced as selling one kilogram and 750.93 grams of heroin.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against R. T. Defense No information is available on R. T. s
    defense. Judgment Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz
    condemned R. T. to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He or
    she was hanged in Tabriz Central Prison in 2004. The exact date of
    execution is unknown.
