    News of the execution of Mr. Ma ruf Sohrabi, along with five other
    Peshmerga of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, was published on
    the central website of this party on October 21, 2011, the Association of
    Iranian Political Prisoners (in Exile) on April 14, 2004, and Asre-nou
    website on April 15, 2004. Additional information was taken from the
    interview of Darush Eslamdust, Mr. Sohrabi s casemate, with Tishik
    Television on October 22, 2014 (YouTube), and the information gathered
    from the Central Office of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (ABF
    interview). Mr. Sohrabi was single, from Paveh, Kermanshah. He was a
    Peshmerga member of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan. The
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) was founded in 1945 with the
    goal to gain autonomy for Kurdistan, in northwestern Iran. After the
    Revolution, conflicts between the new central Shiite government and mainly
    Sunni Kurdistan regarding the role of minorities in the drafting of the
    constitution, specification of Shiite as the official state religion and,
    particularly, the autonomy of the region, ended in armed clashes between
    the Revolutionary Guards and the Peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI). The
    PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1, 1979, when people went to polls
    to vote for or against the Islamic regime. On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah
    Khomeini called the PDKI the party of Satan and declared it unofficial and
    illegal. Mass executions and fighting broke out and continued for several
    months in the region. By 1983, the PDKI had lost much of its influence in
    the region. In the years since, various leaders of the PDKI have been
    assassinated. Following internal disputes, the party split in 2006 and two
    organizations were established as The Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan, and The Democratic Party of Kurdistan. Background On October
    18, 1996, after completing a non-military organizational duty around
    Paveh, seven Peshmerga of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan were
    returning to their base in Soleimanieh, Iraq where they were arrested by
    armed members of the Islamic Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan* in Kurdistan,
    Iraq. They were taken to the Intelligence Police of Paveh in Iran.
    According to a survivor of this group, quoting the Iranian Intelligence
    Police agents, the Islamic Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan had taken this
    group to the Iranian Intelligence Police in exchange for receiving money.
    The Islamic Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan denied this allegation. In a
    letter to the Secretary General of the United Nations and Morris
    Capitoren, the representative of the Special Commission for Human Rights
    in Iran, the Secretary General of the Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan demanded efforts to save these individuals. (Asre-nou website)
    According to the statement by the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan,
    in response to a letter by the Deputy Head of the Human Rights group in
    the UK parliament, the ambassador of the Islamic Republic in the UK
    announced that while these individuals were returning from a clash with
    the Islamic Republic s forces, they got into a clash with the forces of
    the Islamic Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan, during which six of them were
    killed and the seventh person, Darush Eslamdust, was captured. He was
    freed later through the efforts of his relatives. (Central Website of the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan) Arrest and detention Mr. Sohrabi
    was arrested, along with six other Peshmerga of the Democratic Party of
    Iranian Kurdistan, by members of the Islamic Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan*
    in the Anab Village near Halabja in Iraqi Kurdistan on October 18, 1996.
    They were taken to the Iranian Intelligence Police at the Iran/Iraq border
    with their hands and feet tied and their eyes blindfolded. (Interview on
    Tishik Television with Mr. Eslamdust) They were detained at the detention
    center of the Intelligence Police in Paveh for three days. Then they were
    transferred to the detention center of the Intelligence Police in
    Kermanshah where they were detained for seven months. No information is
    available about Mr. Sohrabi s location after that. According to his
    casemate, they were tortured in solitary confinement in the detention
    center of the Intelligence Police in Kermanshah to disclose the activities
    of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan and its secret members in
    Paveh (Interview on Tishik Television with Mr. Eslamdust). After his
    arrest, Mr. Sohrabi had no visitation or contact with his family. His
    family had no news of him or his whereabouts. (ABF interview) Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Sohrabi s trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Sohrabi is not known; however, he was prosecuted for
    his activities and membership in the Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
