    The news of the execution of a man named Ramin was published on the
    website of the Sharq newspaper on January 13, 2004. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. In the report
    of this execution, it is not stated that the case had been referred to a
    higher court. Charges The charge against the defendant was announced as
    "murder". The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that authorities of the Islamic Republic
    have brought trumped-up charges against political opponents and executed
    them for a variety of criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities
    sentence hundreds of alleged common criminals to death, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. According to the paper report, "the defendant had several
    fights allegedly because of his love of his neighbor's daughter in 2000.
    The neighbor was opposed to their marriage. Finally, one day when the
    neighbor was trying to park his car in front of his house, the defendant
    killed him." Defense No information is available on Mr. Ramin's defense.
    Judgment Based on the court ruling, Mr. Ramin was hanged in Tehran on
    January 12, 2004.
