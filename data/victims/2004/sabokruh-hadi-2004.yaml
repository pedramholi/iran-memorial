    News of the execution of Mr. Hadi Sabokruh, along with four others, was
    published in the Ettela at newspaper and, along with five others, in the
    Hamshahri newspaper on September 9, 2004. Additional information was taken
    from the Sharq, Ettela at, and E temad newspapers on September 8, 2004.
    His case is related to the murder of an 18-year-old girl in Kianshahr in
    September of 2001. Arrest and detention Mr. Sabokruh was arrested several
    days after the body of a young girl was found in September of 2001. He was
    detained for three years (Sharq newspaper). According to another report,
    he went to Department 10 of the Intelligence Police and surrendered after
    another person was arrested by mistake (Hamshahri newspaper). The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 1608
    of the Criminal Court of Tehran tried Mr. Sabokruh. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Sabokruh
    was announced as murder. He went to the victim s house, pretending to
    talk, but murdered the young girl, robbed the place, and escaped. (Ettela
    at newspaper) The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Sabokruh was recovery of the victim s body, testimony of the victim s
    friends, and his own confession. International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Sabokruh s defense. Judgment Branch 1608 of the Criminal Court of
    Tehran condemned Mr. Hadi Sabokruh to death. Branch 20 of the Supreme
    Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged, along with two others, in the
    presence of officials, including the judge of Sentence Enforcement, at the
    Evin Prison yard in Tehran on September 8, 2004.
