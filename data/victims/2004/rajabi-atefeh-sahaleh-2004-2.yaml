    A 16-year-old girl who had been arrested three times in the course of one
    year, on charges of Non-Muhsan Zina , and was sentenced to 100 lashes each
    time, was sentenced to be hanged in public after her fourth arrest. News
    of the execution of Ms. Atefeh Sahaleh (Rajabi), child of Bibi Ra ee and
    Safarali, was published in Kayhan newspaper (August 22, 2004) and on the
    Amnesty International website (August 23, 2004). Additional information
    about this case was obtained from news published in Iran (August 29, 2004)
    and Etemad (September 21, 2004) newspapers, ISNA Iranian Students News
    Agency website (September 10, 2004), Mazandnume News and Analysis Website
    (August 22, 2004, September 11 and 30, 2004, February 16, 2005), and from
    the Amnesty International Report dated January 1, 2011. Ms. Sahaleh was
    born on September 21, 1987, to an extremely poor family in the town of
    Neka in Mazandaran Province. Her family moved to [the city of] Mashhad
    after her birth. Her parents were divorced when she was still a toddler,
    with her father assuming guardianship of the children. Her mother
    remarried after the divorce and died in an automobile accident when Ms.
    Sahaleh was 5 years old. A short while later, Ms. Sahaleh s brother
    drowned in a river. Her father was an itinerant vendor, and he would leave
    Ms. Sahaleh and her sister with the neighbors since he had to travel to
    other towns. At one point he entrusted them to the Khorassan Province
    Welfare Organization for a while, until he ultimately took them to their
    grandparents home in the town of Neka and left for good. When Ms. Sahaleh
    got a little older, she had to assume all the responsibilities at her
    grandfather s home, and take care of her 90-year-old grandfather and
    70-year-old grandmother. Her relatives and people close to her describe
    her as a very kind girl. (Mazandnume, ISNA). Ms. Sahaleh s case was
    related to sex crimes. Arrest and detention The town of Neka police
    officers arrested Ms. Sahaleh in May 2004, at her grandfather s home. On
    April 25, 2003, Neka law enforcement officials received unsigned reports
    against Ms. Sahaleh which were said to be from the people living in the
    neighborhood. A few days later, following her grandfather lodging a
    complaint against her, a judicial official issued a warrant for Ms.
    Sahaleh s arrest. After her arrest, the agents proceeded to search the
    home and arrested another young girl who was in the house at the time,
    along with Ms. Sahaleh. Two men, who, according to Ms. Sahaleh, had
    relations with her were arrested and questioned as well. (Iran newspaper).
    Ms. Sahaleh was arrested on the basis of unsigned local reports and her
    grandfather's complaint. Ms. Sahaleh s father announced in an interview
    that during the three months Ms. Sahaleh was in detention, he only visited
    with her for 10 minutes. (Mazandnume). There is no information regarding
    other details of Ms. Sahaleh s arrest and detention. Trial The town of
    Neka General Court Branch One tried Ms. Sahaleh. Since Ms. Sahaleh could
    not afford to hire an attorney, she was assigned a court-appointed one.
    There is no information about the trial session(s). Charges The charge
    against Ms. Sahaleh s was declared to be Non-Musena Zina ( Fornication ,
    or consensual sexual intercourse between two people not married to each
    other, unlawful in Islam) [1]. (Kayhan newspaper, Mazandnume). However, a
    Neka judiciary official stated that the charges brought against Ms.
    Sahaleh were Efsad fel-Arz ( spreading corruption on Earth ) through
    establishing a corruption center , as well as unlawful (contrary to Shar a
    law) sexual relations and indecent acts [against chastity] . (Mazandnume).
    She was first arrested when she was only 14 and was charged with
    corruption and fornication . The second arrest occurred less than two
    months later, and the third one about six months after that. She had been
    sentenced to a total of 300 lashes. Based on available information, during
    her trial sessions, Ms. Sahaleh admitted and confessed to four counts of
    fornication and to undergoing the Hadd punishment of flogging three times.
    (Kayhan and Iran newspapers). Prior to her last arrest, Ms. Sahaleh had
    been arrested and charged with corruption and fornication on three
    separate occasions and was convicted and sentenced each time to 100
    lashes. These sentences had been carried out in the space of less than a
    year, on January 17, 2002, and March 16, 2002, (when she was just 14 years
    old) and September 21, 2002 (six months after the second sentence).
    (Mazandnume). Evidence of guilt The Town of Neka General Court Branch One
    judge cited a complaint lodged by Ms. Sahaleh s grandfather and unsigned
    reports from several neighborhood residents alleging that a young girl in
    this neighborhood has engaged in corruption and prostitution, and has
    immoral relations with a number of individuals as evidence for Ms. Sahaleh
    s arrest and prosecution. Pursuant to the judge s order, an inquiry was
    made with Behshahr Prison regarding Ms. Sahal
