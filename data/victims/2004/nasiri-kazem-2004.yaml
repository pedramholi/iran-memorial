    News of the execution of Mr. Kazem Nasiri was published in the Iran
    newspaper on July 27, 2004. Additional information was taken from the
    Ettela at newspaper on November 20, 2001, and Iran and Sharq newspapers on
    July 26, 2004. His case was related to the murder of a 22-year-old student
    at Manzarieh in Karaj on October 19, 2001, and shooting and injuring a
    woman. Arrest and detention Mr. Nasiri was arrested at Raja ishahr in
    Karaj on December 5, 2002. According to the existing information, in
    November of 2002 the judge of Branch 35 of the General Court in Karaj
    issued a statement, published in newspapers, with Mr. Nasiri s picture and
    specifications demanding the public for help revealing his hiding place.
    On the day of his arrest, a resident of Raja ishahr contacted police,
    reporting that an armed young man was residing in the guard chamber of a
    construction site. After he was arrested, the defendant introduced himself
    as Zaynal; however, police inspectors identified him as Mr. Nasiri based
    on his case (Ettela at newspaper). He had been arrested for robbery
    several months earlier but had escaped during his transfer from courthouse
    to prison. He was detained for two years and five months. Trial Branch 119
    of the Criminal Court in Karaj tried Mr. Nasiri. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Nasiri
    were announced as murder, participation in an armed robbery, assault and
    battery, possession of an illegal weapon, and creating intimidation and
    fear in Karaj and Fardis. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Nasiri was complaint by the victim s family, the defendant s
    confession, identical bullets used to shoot his ex-girlfriend and the
    student, recovery of the student s body, and having a record for robbery.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense During an interview, Mr. Nasiri stated that he was
    in love, wandering the streets, and was in a bad way (Iran newspaper on
    July 27, 2004). During his interrogation, he also stated that he was in
    love with a girl and intended to marry her. However, she married someone
    else. Then, he went to the girl s home, armed, in order to convince her to
    escape with him. Instead he shot and injured the girl. In addition, during
    the carjacking, he did not intend to kill the driver. He only wanted to
    threaten him but was forced to shoot. Finally, he claimed that he was a
    lover and not a murderer. (Iran newspaper on July 26, 2004) Judgment
    Branch 119 of the Criminal Court in Karaj condemned Mr. Kazem Nasiri to
    death, 18 months imprisonment, and 50 lashes. Branch 27 of the Supreme
    Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in public and in the presence of
    the Sentence Enforcement judge, the representative of the Karaj
    Courthouse, the Deputy Public Prosecutor, Assistant Public Prosecutor of
    Branch One of Sentence Enforcement, forensics, the Chief of Police in
    Fardis, the victim s family, and the defendant s mother at Oshaq Square in
    Fardis, Karaj, on July 26, 2004 in the morning.
