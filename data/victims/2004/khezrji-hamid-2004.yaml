    The execution of Mr. Hamid Khezrji was reported in Kayhan Newspaper
    (October 14, 2004) and according to the Office of Information and Public
    Relations of the Ministry of Justice of the Province of Khuzestan
    Jomhuri-ye Islami Newspaper (October 2, 2004). His case has to do with
    armed robbery. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Khezrji s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Public Court of the Province
    of Khuzestan tried Mr. Khezrji. No information is available on his trial.
    Charges The charges brought against Mr. Khezrji were armed robbery,
    assault, and causing injury (Kayhan Newspaper). The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence given against Mr.
    Khezrji was 17 counts of armed robbery and several counts of assault and
    bodily injury (Kayhan Newspaper). International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Khezrji s defense. Judgment The Public Court of Khuzestan condemned
    Mr. Khezrji to death by hanging. This sentence was approved by the Supreme
    Court. He was executed by public hanging in Golestan Boulevard, Koodak
    Square, in Ahvaz on Wednesday, September 29, 2004.
