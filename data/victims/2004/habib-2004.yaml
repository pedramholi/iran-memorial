    News of the execution of Mr. Habib (no last name) was reported in Iran
    Newspaper (September 29, 2004) and E temad-e Melli Newspaper (September
    30, 2004). He was married, had a child, and was employed as a security
    guard in a food production company in the town of Shahriyar. His case
    concerns the abduction and rape of young girls which took place in the
    Bord Abad area of the town of Shahriyar, Karaj in 1991. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Habib was identified and arrested on May 26, 1991 by
    paramilitary militia (Basij) officials from the Shahid Shiroodi Base in
    Shahriyar (Iran Newspaper). Based on available information, on May 13,
    1991 the father of an eight-year-old girl went to the Komiteh of Shahriyar
    and reported that on May 11, his daughter had been raped by a man dressed
    in black clothes and a black hat. During the police investigation, two
    other fathers reported that their daughters, aged 9 and 12, had also been
    raped. Another 12-year-old girl also reported that a man matching this
    description had lured her into a garden with a story about buying
    cigarettes. She had managed to escape. Afterwards, one of the victims had
    seen the man in her neighborhood and notified the police. With the aid of
    a composite picture of the man, police were able to trace him to the food
    production company. In preliminary questioning, Mr. Habib said that he had
    intended to help the girls, but after the victims identified him he
    confessed to his deeds. He spent 13 years in prison. Trial Branch 6 of the
    Criminal Court of Karaj tried Mr. Habib. There is no record of the
    proceedings. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Habib was three counts
    of child rape, and one count of abduction and attempted rape of a
    nine-year-old girl. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence given against
    Mr. Habib was victims complaints, identification by victims, and his own
    confession. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense As Mr. Habib did not accept the
    verdict, his case was referred to the Supreme Court. There is no record of
    his defense. He appealed his case and asked for pardon and a shorter
    sentence from Raja i Shahr Prison in 2001. Judgment Branch 6 of the
    Criminal Court of Karaj sentenced Mr. Habib to execution by hanging for
    raping three girls; three years penal imprisonment for abduction and
    attempted rape; and a fine for violating the virginity of the three girls.
    This sentence was approved by Branch 26 of the Supreme Court, and he was
    executed by hanging on the morning of September 29, 2004 in Raja i Shahr
    Prison in Karaj. Before his execution, he wrote his will.
