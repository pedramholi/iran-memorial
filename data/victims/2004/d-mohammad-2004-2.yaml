    The news of the execution of Mr. Mohammad D. was published on the website
    of the Sharq newspaper on October 11, 2004. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    According to the media reports, quoting the Information and Public
    Relation Office of Khuzestan Province Court, the charges against the
    defendant were "participation in four armed robberies, using Kalashnikov
    and colt weapons, injuring other people on purpose, creating intimidation,
    fear, and insecurity among the people, along with stealing a car and some
    money." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the authorities of Islamic Republic
    have brought trumped-up charges against political opponents and executed
    them for a variety of criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities
    sentence hundreds of alleged common criminals to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mohammad D's
    defense. Judgment The court condemned the defendant to death. The Supreme
    Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in public on Kutabdollah Road in
    Ahvaz on October 10, 2004.
