    News of the execution of Mr. Kamran Razaqi, son of Mohsen, along with two
    other individuals, was announced by the website of ISNA (September 7,
    2004), and, citing the Public Relations section of the Public and Islamic
    Revolutionary courts of Tehran, by Sharq daily, Kayhan daily and E temad
    daily (September 8, 2004). Additional information on this case was
    obtained from Islamic Republic daily and Iran daily (March 27, 2001),
    Kayhan daily (September 8-11, 2001), and Iran daily (January 31, 2001 July
    2, 2002), all citing the Acting Commander of Tehran s Police Force Central
    Command. In 1977, Mr. Razaqi went to the United States with his brother,
    became naturalized there, and then returned to Iran in 1998. His case
    along with that of 35 other individuals, known as the Nicosia Cartel,
    pertains to trafficking of illegal drugs. Arrest and detention Mr. Razaqi
    was arrested in Tehran in January-February 2001 after he and the other
    members of the cartel had been under police surveillance for a year and a
    half. He spent four years in prison (Kayhan daily, September 8, 2001).
    However, there is no information available on the details of Mr. Razaqi s
    arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Razaqi and the other 35 were tried by
    Branch 24 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran. The first session
    of the trial was held on September 7, 2001 and the second on September 10,
    2001. However, there is no information available on the details of the
    further session or sessions of Mr. Razaqi s trial. Charges Mr. Razaqi was
    charged with participating in the creation of a network for purchase and
    sale of illegal drugs, both in and outside of the country [Iran], as well
    as sowing corruption among the youth. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The confessions of the defendants, possession of 19 kilograms and
    600 grams of heroin and cocaine, and the discovery of 3 kilograms and 800
    grams of heroin as well as 600 grams of cocaine were entered as evidence
    of guilt against Mr. Razaqi. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. Razaqi objected to the
    ruling of the court, as a result of which his case was referred to the
    Supreme Court. However, there is no further information available on the
    details of his defense. Judgment Branch 24 of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Tehran sentenced Mr. Kamran Razaqi to two times of execution. The
    Supreme Court validated the verdict. Mr. Razaqi was hanged, along with two
    others, in Rajaee-Shahr Prison on Tuesday, September 7, 2004. The other
    members of the drug cartel received 10- or 15-year prison sentences and
    fines, as well as rulings for confiscation of belongings.
