    News of the execution of Mr. M. A. Salehi was published in the Khorasan
    newspaper on June 30, 2004. He was 65 years old and his case was related
    to narcotics. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Salehi s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Salehi s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Salehi was
    announced as narcotics related. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against Mr. Salehi. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Salehi s defense. Judgment Mr. M. A.
    Salehi was hanged in Torbat-e Heydarieh. The circumstances and date of his
    execution is unknown.
