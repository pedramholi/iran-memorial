    News of the execution of Mr. Amin Janatitabar, son of Mohammad, along with
    two other individuals, was announced by the website of ISNA (September 7,
    2004), and, citing the Public Relations section of the Public and Islamic
    Revolutionary courts of Tehran, by Sharq daily, Kayhan daily and E temad
    daily (September 8, 2004). Additional information on this case was
    obtained from Islamic Republic daily and Iran daily (March 27, 2001),
    Kayhan daily (September 8-11, 2001), and Iran daily (January 31, 2001 July
    2, 2002), all citing the Acting Commander of Tehran s Police Force Central
    Command. The case of Mr. Janatitabar along with that of 35 other
    individuals, known as the Nicosia Cartel, pertains to international
    trafficking of illegal drugs. Mr. Janatitabar acted as liaison between the
    cartel and its two drug lords. Arrest and detention Mr. Janatitabar was
    arrested in Tehran in January- February 2001 after he and the other
    members of the cartel had been under police surveillance for a year and a
    half. He spent four years in prison. However, there is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Janatitabar s arrest and detention. Trial
    Mr. Janatitabar and the other 35 were tried by Branch 24 of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Tehran. The first session of the trial was held on
    September 7, 2001 and the second on September 10, 2001. However, there is
    no information available on the details of the further session or sessions
    of Mr. Janatitabar s trial. Charges Mr. Janatitabar was charged with
    participating in the importation of more the one kilogram of cocaine to
    Iran, and its distribution; discovery of cocaine [on his person or
    somewhere associated with him]; participating in storing, carrying and
    transferring at least 12 rugs in which illegal drugs had been hidden; and
    use of cocaine and sowing corruption among the youth. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The confessions of the defendants and the
    discovery of 460 grams of cocaine as well as 828 grams of heroin were
    entered as evidence of guilt against Mr. Janatitabar. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    Mr. Janatitabar objected to the ruling of the court, as a result of which
    his case was referred to the Supreme Court. However, there is no further
    information available on the details of his defense. Judgment Branch 24 of
    the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran initially sentenced Mr. Amin
    Janatitabar to two terms of imprisonment for life as well as government
    confiscation of all his belongings. The Supreme Court did not validate the
    verdict and sent it back to the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran for
    revision, upon which Mr. Janatitabar was sentenced to two times of
    execution. This time the Supreme Court validated the verdict. Mr.
    Janatitabar was hanged along with two others in Rajaee-Shahr Prison on
    Tuesday, September 7, 2004. The other members of the drug cartel received
    10- or 15-year prison sentences and fines, as well as rulings for
    confiscation of belongings.
