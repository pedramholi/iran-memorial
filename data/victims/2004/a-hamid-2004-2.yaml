circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Hamid A., along with two other people, was reported
    in Jomhuri-ye Islami Newspaper and Kayhan Newspaper citing the Public
    Relations Office of the Ministry of Justice of Kerman (August 21, 2004).
    His case has to do with armed drug smuggling and arms possession. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Hamid A. was arrested, along with another person, by the
    Kerman Provincial Province. The arrest took place at his warehouse on
    Abuzar Street in Kerman. The details of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial The Revolutionary Court of Kerman tried Mr. Hamid A. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against
    Mr. Hamid A. were participating in armed drug smuggling, specifically
    opium and morphine, and possession of arms and ammunition . The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence against Mr.
    Hamid A. and another suspect was possession of 3500 kilograms drugs,
    specifically opium and morphine, 11 Kalashnikov rifles, one RPG-7 rocket
    launcher, four Colt revolvers, one Goryunov machine gun, and enough
    ammunition for all of these weapons . International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Hamid A. s defense. Judgment The Revolutionary Court
    of Kerman sentenced Mr. Hamid A. to death by hanging. This sentence was
    approved by the Supreme Court. On August 19, 2004, he and two other people
    were publicly executed in Haft Bagh Square in Kerman.
