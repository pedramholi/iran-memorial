    News of the execution of Mr. Dalir Mohammadi, along with another person,
    was published in the Jomhuri Eslami Newspaper on March 10 and in the
    Hamshahri newspaper on March 11, 2004. Additional information about this
    case is taken from the Sharq and Hamshahri newspapers on March 3, 2004.
    Mr. Mohammadi, 24, was from Baneh in Kurdistan. According to the existing
    information, his case was related to the kidnapping that resulted in the
    murder of an eight-year-old child in Baneh on February 16, 2004. (Sharq
    and Hamshahri newspapers on March 3, 2004) According to the Sharq
    newspaper, students in Baneh along with other citizens demonstrated and
    signed a petition calling for immediate trial of the defendants including
    Mr. Mohammadi. (March 3, 2004) Arrest and detention Mr. Mohammadi was
    arrested in March of 2004 after the body of a kidnapped boy was recovered
    besides the bridge on the Sovil Village River. (Sharq newspaper on March
    3, 2004) There is no specific information on his arrest and detention.
    Trial Branch One of the Public Court of Baneh tried Mr. Mohammadi and two
    other defendants of this case in March of 2004. This trial took place out
    of turn because of what the judge called hurting public emotions, fear of
    intimidation in town, and protecting and defending public security in
    society. (Sharq newspaper on March 3, 2004) No detailed information is
    available on this trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Mohammadi was
    announced as "kidnapping resulting in murder". Mr. Mohammadi along with
    two other defendants of this case had kidnapped and killed an 8-year-old
    boy named Sina Mahmudi, to extort 70 million Iraqi Dinars from his
    parents. (Hamshahri newspaper on March 11, 2004) The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence provided against the defendants included the recovery of the
    victim s body three days after his disappearance and the coroner s report
    about harassment, tying hands, and suffocation of the victim. (Hamshahri
    newspaper on March 3, 2004) According to the Sharq newspaper, Mr.
    Mohammadi accepted the charge of kidnapping resulting in the murder.
    (March 3, 2004) Defense No information is available on Mr. Mohammadi s
    defense and it is not clear if he had an attorney. According to the
    published reports, this case was prosecuted out of turn and the time
    between the arrest of the defendants and their convictions and carrying
    out the ruling had been very short. According to the Sharq newspaper, the
    first row defendant of this case, Mr. Rahimi, told the court that they had
    kidnapped the boy to extort from his father and they did not intend to
    kill him. However, they killed him because the victim had identified his
    detaining location. Judgment Branch One of the Public Court of Baneh
    condemned Mr. Dalir Mohammadi to death and 15 years imprisonment in March
    of 2004. The court also condemned the first row defendant to death, three
    counts, and the third row defendant to 15 years imprisonment. The Supreme
    Court investigated the case out of turn and confirmed the ruling. Mr.
    Mohammadi was hanged, along with another defendant of this case, in the
    Baneh Prison on Monday March 8, 2004 in the morning. (Hamshahri newspaper
