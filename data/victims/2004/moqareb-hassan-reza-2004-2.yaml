    The news of the execution of Mr. Hassan Rreza Moqareb known as "Spider
    Man" was published on the website of the Sharq newspaper on January 13,
    2004. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges According to the Judicial Deputy Chief of the
    Khorasan Province Court, the charges against the defendant were
    "kidnapping, robbery, and rape." Evidence of guilt According to the
    Judicial Deputy Chief of the Khorasan Province Court, "the defendant was
    first charged for raping a nine-year-old girl. Then, he confessed raping
    other children." International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    Station broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to
    vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs,
    and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to
    the pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who have been
    freed. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hassan Reza Moqareb's
    defense. Judgment Based on the court decision and the confirmation of the
    Supreme Court, Mr. Hasan-reza Moqareb was condemned to 15 years
    imprisonment for kidnapping, 10 years for robbery, and death for rape. The
    ruling was executed in public in the Edalat Square of Mashhad on January
    12, 2004.
