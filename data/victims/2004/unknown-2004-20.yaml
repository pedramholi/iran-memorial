    News of the execution of an unknown man was published on the website of
    the Iran newspaper on May 5, 2004. He was married, 43, and a prisoner at
    Raja ishahr Prison in Karaj, condemned to life imprisonment for drug
    trafficking. According to this report, his case was related to supplying
    and transferring narcotics into the Raja ishahr Prison in Karaj. Arrest
    and detention According to the existing information, agents of Raja ishahr
    Prison in Karaj identified and arrested this prisoner, after arresting his
    wife, who had attempted to smuggle 200 grams of heroin into the prison,
    during her visitation on October 11, 2001. Trial Following a complaint
    filed by the warden of Raja ishahr Prison in Karaj, Branch One of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court in Karaj tried this person. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against the defendant
    were announced as participation in supplying and smuggling narcotics into
    the prison. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. However, according to the
    existing information, 200 grams of heroin were recovered from his wife
    while attempting to smuggle them into the prison during a visitation.
    Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense. Judgment
    Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Karaj condemned this
    person to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged
    at the Qezelhesar Prison in Karaj on May 4, 2004.
