    News of the execution of Mr. Reza S. was published in the Iran newspaper
    on January 10, 2004. Additional information was taken from the Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper on December 2, 2003. According to the existing
    information, he was married, had a criminal record, and his case was
    related to the kidnapping and rape of 23 children between the age of 6 and
    11 years old in Tabriz. Arrest and detention The Criminal Investigators in
    Tabriz arrested Mr. Reza S. while he was molesting a seven-year-old girl
    on July 8, 2003. He was identified during the police investigation
    following several complaints filed by parents of rape victims. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 38
    of the General Court in Tabriz tried Mr. Reza S. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Reza S.
    were announced as rape, robbery, and kidnapping. According to the existing
    information, he was accused of deceiving and taking 23 children, between 6
    and 11 years old, to construction buildings around Tabriz, threatening
    them with a knife, stealing their gold, and raping them. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    According to the existing information, the bases for Mr. Reza S. s
    conviction was his confession (Jomhuri Eslami newspaper). International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
