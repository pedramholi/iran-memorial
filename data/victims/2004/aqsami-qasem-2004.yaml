    The execution of Mr. Qasem Aqsami, along with another person, was reported
    in E temad Newspaper, Iran Newspaper (September 9, 2004), Kayhan
    Newspaper, and the Office of Prisons Website (September 11, 2004).
    Additional information was found in Iran Newspaper (September 9, 2003 and
    August 25 and 26, 2004), and Kayhan Newspaper (August 26, 2004). He was a
    native of Gilan. After separating from his wife, he had been living with
    his two children. His case, along with those of four other people, has to
    do with the kidnapping, rape, and assault and battery of several women and
    young girls in 2002. Arrest and detention Mr. Aqsami was arrested in
    Mohammad Shahr, Karaj along with two other people on October 17, 2002.
    These three people had been pursued by police since July 6, 2002.
    Complaints had been lodged against them by the family of a girl who had
    been kidnapped and assaulted by these men. The Chief of Police of Karaj
    ordered several teams of detectives to find them. The detectives kept a
    few locations in Karaj under surveillance, and finally found a red car
    with three men and a woman passenger. After these individuals were
    apprehended, the judge at Branch 119 of the Criminal Court of Karaj
    ordered their pictures to be printed in newspapers. Several girls and
    young women recognized the men from their pictures. They went to the
    police station, identified the suspects, and reported that they had been
    assaulted by these men. The suspects then confessed, and two other people
    were also arrested as a result who then spent two years in jail. Trial
    Branch 119 of the Revolutionary and Public Court of Karaj tried Mr. Aqsami
    and the other men. This trial was carried out in several sessions, however
    no information is available on the details of this trial. Charges The
    charges brought against Mr. Aqsami were assault and battery of women and
    young girls, four counts of kidnapping, and extortion with aggravated
    assault . The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence against Mr. Aqsami was
    confession of the suspects, complaints of the victims, identification of
    the suspects by the victims, and discovery of stolen jewelry . In the
    preliminary stages of questioning, these men denied any kind of kidnapping
    and assault and battery of women. After being confronted by the victims,
    they confessed. According to the confessions of the suspects, they
    kidnapped the women under the guise of giving rides, threatened them with
    knives, and took them to deserted areas. They would steal their jewelry,
    rape them, and abandon them. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Aqsami s defense. Judgment Branch 119 of the Revolutionary and Public
    Court of Karaj sentenced Mr. Qasem Aqsami to death by hanging for assault
