    The information about the death of Mr. Mohsen Mofidi was released by
    Amnesty International on February 25, 2004. Arrest and detention According
    to Amnesty International's Urgent Action Call of February 13, 2004, "Mr.
    Mofidi and his three sisters were arrested by the morality police in July
    2003, at their home in Tehran. All were released on bail and ordered to
    attend court for trial on July 28, 2003." In compliance with the court's
    order, Mohsen Mofidi turned himself in on January 10, 2004 to begin his
    jail sentence. On February 11, the 25th anniversary of the 1979 revolution
    in Iran, his prison sentence was suspended and his release was scheduled.
    At the time, Amnesty International believed that his flogging sentence
    would be carried out on the final day of his detention. According to this
    organization, prison officials allegedly told him that he would be able to
    keep his shirt on during the lashing if he gave them a bribe. Mohsen
    Mofidi was reported to be in Qasr prison in Tehran, where he had been
    denied access to his family. He was told by prison officials that for an
    additional payment of $4,000 ($1000 of which was to be paid immediately),
    he would be transferred to a better part of the prison and would be
    allowed to receive visitors. He had reportedly suffered from a lung and
    sinus infections while he was in prison and had spent a week in a medical
    facility in Qasr prison, during which time he had periods of
    semi-consciousness. It is believed that he had not fully recovered at the
    time of his flogging. Trial Amnesty reports that: "Mohsen apparently did
    not have access to adequate legal representation during his trial, as the
    person appointed to act as his lawyer lacked legal qualifications."
    Charges Mr. Mohsen Mofidi was charged with: "possession of medicine
    containing alcohol, consuming alcohol in the early 1980s, possession of a
    television satellite dish, and aiding and abetting his sister's
    ''corruption'' in allowing them to have boyfriends." Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mofidi's defense. Judgment Amnesty reported that "Mohsen
    was sentenced to four months' imprisonment, to be followed by 80 lashes,
    on charges including possession of medicine containing alcohol, consuming
    alcohol 20 years previously, possession of a satellite dish, and aiding
    and abetting his sisters "corruption" (having boyfriends, which they
    allegedly admitted to having after being beaten in custody). He has also
    been fined $239. According to updated regulations of December 2003,
    flogging is carried out with leather cords of 1.5cm thickness, which are
    1m long; usually the prisoner's legs and hands are bound. Mr. Mofidi was
    released after the flogging was carried out. He was apparently in poor
    health when he arrived at the home of a relative in Tehran, where his
    condition deteriorated and he later died. The day he died, he had been
    taken to a hospital and given antibiotics for his lung and sinus
    infections. A doctor has reportedly certified that his death was due to a
    heart attack. Mohsen Mofidi had no heart complaints before. Responding to
    a question concerning the victim's death, the spokesman for the Judiciary,
    Dr. Gholam Hosein Elham said, I have not received any information
    regarding such an incident from the Department of Justice or from the
    penitentiary administration. What is the press looking for by
    investigating such incidents? If something happens in prison to a
    detainee, would that necessarily be the result of an illegal act
    (committed by the prison s authorities)? It is possible that a convict
    gets accidentally harmed consequently to the proper and lawful meting out
    of a punishment. The effect of a punishment that is lawful is not
    considered a crime or torture (Iran Labor News Agency, March 10, 2004).
