    The news of the conviction and execution of Mr. Kheydan Gholamipur, son of
    Namdar, was published on the websites of Sharq newspaper on January 13,
    2004 and Jomhuri Eslami newspapers on November 30, and December 2, 2003.
    Additional information about this case was provided to the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center via an electronic form by a person familiar with his case
    (e-form November 7, 2017). He was born in 1968/69 in Miyantanghe
    Malakshahi. He had a high school diploma, was married and had two sons and
    two daughters. He was a member of Kordestan democratic party. Arrest and
    detention The Jomhuri Eslami newspaper quotes Public Relation of Ilam s
    Prosecution Office: "After the murder of eight pilgrims from Nishabur in
    Rekovaz Malekshahi on September 13, 2003, two people, identified as
    Kheydan Gholamipur and Bani Salehi, were arrested and charged
    immediately." There is no more information about this arrest in the
    papers. Trial According to the media reports, Mr. Gholamipur was tried at
    the Criminal Court of Ilam province, as well as Ilam s Public and
    Revolutionary Court. His death sentence was confirmed by the Supreme
    Court. Charges The charges against Mr. Gholamipur were announced as
    "murder, Moharebe (fighting), and Mofsed (corruptor on earth)." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against Mr. Gholamipur cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and subsequent execution for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence hundreds of alleged common criminals to death,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no
    evidence provided against Mr. Gholamipur. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Gholamipurs defense. Judgment Based on the court decision
    and the confirmation of the Supreme Court, Mr. KHeydan Gholamipur was
    condemned to eight counts of execution in public. On the morning of
    January 12, 2004, he was hanged in the Qoran Square of Ilam in presence of
    the victims' families.
