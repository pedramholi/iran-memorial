    The news of the execution of Ms. Monireh Qasempur was published on the
    websites of the Sharq newspaper on August 9, and also the Iran newspaper
    on July 13, 2004. Arrest and detention According to the Iran newspaper,
    when the body of a 78-year-old man was discovered in his bathroom on
    February 15, 2001, the police began investigating and suspected the
    victim's daughter-in-law. They interrogated the 27-year-old woman. Trial
    According to the Sharq newspaper, the defendant was tried in Primary
    Court. Charges The charge against the defendant was given as "murdering
    her Father-in-law." Evidence of guilt According to the Iran newspaper, the
    defendant confessed to her crime. International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    Station broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to
    vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs,
    and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to
    the pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who have been
    freed. Defense In her defense, the defendant stated that her motivation
    for committing the crime was her father-in law’s tormenting her and
    interfering in her life. Judgment According to the Sharq newspaper, the
    Primary Court condemned the defendant to death and the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. She was executed in Qazvin Central Prison on July
    11, 2004.
