    "whyText": "Since its founding in 1979, the Islamic Republic of Iran has systematically persecuted and killed dissidents, ethnic and religious minorities, women, students, and ordinary citizens. From the mass executions of the 1980s to the chain murders of the 1990s, from the 2019 crackdown to the 2022 protests — victims are often forgotten, their stories left untold. This memorial puts an end to that silence.",
